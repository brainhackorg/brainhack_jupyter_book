## R

### Reliability
Typically defined as the ratio of within-subject variability to between-subject variability (ie. Intraclass correlation coefficient).

### Redistribution

### Registered Report
A published report describing the hypotheses and planned method of a study, before the data is collected. Also known as a ‘pre-registration’ or ‘pre-reg’.

### Repository
A long-lived place on the internet where resources (be they data, software, publications or anything else) can be stored and accessed. This keyword is often shortened to ‘repo’.

### Reproducibility
The degree to which the same methods, results, and inferences of a study can be produced again. Methods reproducibility is the degree to which the methods described in a study report can be performed again. This may be limited by a vague description in the study report or lack of openness in the data. Results reproducibility is the degree to which the same results are produced, in a new study with the same method Inferential reproducibility is the degree to which the same inferences are drawn, either in a new study with the same method and results or in a re-analysis of the original study. Generally speaking, when discussing reproducibility it is important to specify the changing conditions across which measurement/findings are being reproduced. Computational reproducibility, cross-sample reproducibility, and cross-site reproducibility and other forms all specify the changing conditions under which reproducibility is being measured.

### README File
File where you document your research data. The documentation should be sufficient to enable other researchers to understand, replicate or reproduce the data or reuse them in any other way.

### Reporting Bias
Reporting bias occurs when certain aspects of a study are systematically not reported transparently, creating wastage and redundancy through selective reporting or non-publishing.

### Repository
The infrastructure and corresponding service that allows for the persistent, efficient and sustainable storage of digital objects (such as documents, data and code).

### Reproducible Research
Reproducibility is a spectrum and instructors should choose the definition most used by their audience. Generally speaking, reproducible research makes it possible to obtain similar results of a study or experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods but under different conditions (i.e., pertains to results). Some break the definition into levels of reproducibility, including computationally reproducible (also called "reproducible"): where code and data can be analyzed in a similar manner as in the original research to achieve the same results, and empirically reproducible (also called “replicable”): where an independent researcher can repeat a study using the same methods but creating new data.

### Research Impact
Involve academic, economic and societal aspects, or some combination of all three. Impact is the demonstrable contribution that research makes in shifting understanding and advancing scientific, method, theory and application across and within disciplines, and the broader role that this plays outside of the research system.

### Unconference
An unconference is a participant-driven meeting.
The term "unconference" has been applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of gatherings that try to avoid hierarchical aspects of a conventional conference, such as sponsored presentations and top-down organization {cite}`wiki:unconference`.
Commonly, participants present their research, project work, or any other topics of current interest in an informal setting to other participants.
The content of an unconference is usually decided very shortly before or during the Brainhack event itself, often inspired by ongoing within-team discussions that could be of interest to the larger group.
