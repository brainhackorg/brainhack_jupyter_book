# Preprint Acknowledgments

_See the latest version of the acknowledgments page [here](/acknowledgments)._

The present manuscript is part of a growing community effort to collate BrainHack related insights and expertise into a [Jupyter Book](http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book) that will serve as a centralized set of resources for the community; we acknowledge all the individuals who contributed and will make ongoing contributions to these resources.
Moreover, we would like to acknowledge all Brainhack organizers, supporters, presenters, and participants for their contribution to growing and maintaining this community. The benefits described in this manuscript would not be possible without them. We also thank all institutions, labs, and organisations who have helped this community grow, meet in stimulating environments and add an excellent educational resource pool and agenda. With an expanding community, Brainhack’s support network keeps growing and we thank all labs and individual researchers for their dedication and expertise offered to this community.
