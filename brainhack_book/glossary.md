The group addressed by communication (e.g., those in attendance of an Open Science training). The target audience is a group of individuals that will be addressed or affected by the training.

### Author
Authors are considered as any active local or remote contributors to the project at the time of the project developed and finalised, who had a substantial contribution to the project, not only during the time of the project development taken place for a limited time of the Brainhack but until the project has been finalised or came to a stage to publish the results.

### Background

### Brainhack

### Brainhack Global
Brainhack Global (BHG) is an umbrella term for all the hacking events run all around the world and for the central organizing committee which coordinates and helps in the planning and organization of the local events all around the world. Brainhack Global is constituted by a volunteer team of researchers from a variety of research institutions. The team is in charge of designing the proceedings of Brainhack Global as well as maintaining the Brainhack Global materials, websites, and social accounts. Brainhack Global does not run a separate hacking event at any specific location or time but shares the information, materials, and broadcasts from all local event sites during the defined event period.

### Open Access
Open Access refers to online, free of cost access to peer-reviewed scientific content with free reusability regarding copyright restrictions.

### Open access publishing (gratis)
The practice of making research publications available to anyone to read without charge.

### Open access publishing (libre)
Libre open access is gratis, meaning the research is available free of charge, but it goes further by granting users the right to copy, reuse, and remix the publication

### Open Brain Consent

### Open Data
Open Data is online, free of cost, accessible data that can be used, reused and distributed provided that the data source is attributed.

### Open Evaluation
The development of a fair evaluation system or protocol for research proposals, based on transparency of the process and those involved.

### Open Lab Notebooks
A concept of writing about research on a regular basis, such that research notes and data are accumulated and published online as soon as they are obtained.

### Open License
A license is a document that specifies what can and cannot be done with a work. It grants permissions and states restrictions. Broadly speaking, an open license is one that grants permission to access, re-use and redistribute a work with few or no restrictions.

### Open Materials
Sharing of research materials, for example, biological and geological samples, is another Open Science practice.

### Open Neuro

### Open Peer Review
An umbrella term for a number of overlapping ways that peer review models can be adapted in line with the aims of Open Science, including making reviewer and author identities open, publishing review reports and enabling greater participation in the peer review process.

### Open source project
A project in which a significant amount of collaboration between the core or leadership team and the wider community takes place in the form of online interactions. Community interactions should maintain transparency and openness of the project to facilitate the growth of your community.

### Open Science
Movement which aims to improve the strength of scientific inferences and the effectiveness of scientific communication, by reducing **questionable research practices**, and making greater use of practices such as **replication and pre-prints**

### Open Science Framework

### Open Source

### Organic

### Outcome

## P

### P-hacking

### Participant

### Peer Review
A process by which a research article is vetted by experts from the community before publication.

### Peer Working

### Preprint
A manuscript draft that has not yet been subject to formal peer review, distributed to receive early feedback on research from peers.
a complete study report shared with a public audience without peer review. Often, preprints are also submitted for peer review and publication in a
traditional scholarly journal.

### Preregistration
Researchers have the option or are required to submit important information about their study (for example: research rationale, hypotheses, design and analytic strategy) to a public registry before beginning the study. Preregistration can help counter reporting bias.

## R

### Reliability

### Redistribution

### Registered Report
A published report describing the hypotheses and planned method of a study, before the data is collected. Also known as a ‘pre-registration’ or ‘pre-reg’.

### Repeated data inspection

### Replication
Replication the repetition of a study’s method, to corroborate its results. An exact replication
is a repetition using exactly the same procedures as the original stud.

### Repository

A long-lived place on the internet where resources (be they data, software, publications or anything else) can be stored and accessed. This keyword is often shortened to ‘repo’.

### Reproducibility
The degree to which the same methods, results, and inferences of a study can be produced again. Methods reproducibility is the degree to which the methods described in a study report can be performed again. This may be limited by a vague description in the study report or lack of openness in the data. Results reproducibility is the degree to which the same results are produced, in a new study with the same method Inferential reproducibility is the degree to which the same inferences are drawn, either in a new study with the same method and results or in a re-analysis of the original study.

### README file
File where you document your research data. The documentation should be sufficient to enable other researchers to understand, replicate or reproduce the data or reuse them in any other way.

### Reporting Bias
Reporting bias occurs when certain aspects of a study are systematically not reported transparently, creating wastage and redundancy through selective reporting or non-publishing.

### Repository
Repository is defined as the infrastructure and corresponding service that allows for the persistent, efficient and sustainable storage of digital objects (such as documents, data and code).

### Reproducible Research
Reproducibility is a spectrum and instructors should choose the definition most used by their audience. Generally speaking, reproducible research makes it possible to obtain similar results of a study or experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods but under different conditions (i.e., pertains to results). Some break the definition into levels of reproducibility, including computationally reproducible (also called "reproducible"): where code and data can be analyzed in a similar manner as in the original research to achieve the same results, and empirically reproducible (also called “replicable”): where an independent researcher can repeat a study using the same methods but creating new data.

### Research Impact
Involve academic, economic and societal aspects, or some combination of all three. Impact is the demonstrable contribution that research makes in shifting understanding and advancing scientific, method, theory and application across and within disciplines, and the broader role that this plays outside of the research system.

### Research Funder
An institute, corporation or government body that provides financial assistance for research.

### Reuse

### Satellite events

### Scholarly Communication
The creation, transformation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research findings so that they are available to the wider academic community.

### Sharing
The joint use of a resource or space. A fundamental aspect of collaborative research. As most research is digitally-authored & digitally-published, the resulting digital content is non-rivalrous and can be shared without any loss to the original creator.

### Subscription
