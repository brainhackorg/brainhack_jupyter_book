# Acknowledgments

We acknowledge all the individuals who contributed and will make ongoing contributions to the insights and resources included in this Jupyter Book.
Moreover, we would like to acknowledge all Brainhack organizers, supporters, presenters, and participants for their contribution to growing and maintaining this community.
The benefits described in this book would not be possible without them.
We also thank all institutions, labs, and organisations who have helped this community grow, meet in stimulating environments, and add an excellent educational resource pool and agenda. With an expanding community, Brainhack’s support network keeps growing and we thank all labs and individual researchers for their dedication and expertise offered to this community.
