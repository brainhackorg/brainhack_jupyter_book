# Brainhack Book
Since the first Brainhack in 2012, the Brainhack community has dynamically grown and inspired a culture of open, inclusive, community-driven neuroscience. In August 2020, Neuron invited a Brainhack Neuroview piece, and the Brainhack community has worked together on this manuscript that highlights the vision, features and impact of Brainhacks – for individual researchers, the community, and science in general.  

We collectively aimed to include as much of the Brainhack community as possible in writing this piece by extending an open invitation across Brainhack channels of communication. While the Neuroview writing process is almost complete, we invite any members of the community we might have missed to join the community effort in shaping this Brainhack Jupyter Book!

This Jupyter Book is a living and growing resource where the expanding community is warmly invited to contribute, give feedback, and add their own ideas. This resource serves to document the vision, organization, and innovation of Brainhacks around the world, as well as to showcase the diversity of events and initiatives that all contribute to the Brainhack mission.
