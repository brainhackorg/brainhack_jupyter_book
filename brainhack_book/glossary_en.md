training, perspectives, and locations have the means to interact with, contribute to, and gain
something from a project

### Across Field

Interdisciplinary approach combining expertise in different domains, such as different research topics or professions.

### Ad-hoc

A decision or action taken to address something immediately, without having been previously taken into consideration.

### Attendee

Any individual who attends or is present at the event, training, seminar,
workshop, or activity (e.g., participant at Brainhack event, individual present
at Brainhack workshop, etc.)

### Audience

The group that is addressed by intentional communication (e.g., those in
attendance of an Open Science training). The target audience is a group of
individuals that will be addressed or affected by the activity, training,
communication, or action.

### Author

### Brainhack Global (BHG)

An umbrella term that describes all hackathons and hacking events that fall
under the international Brainhack initiative, allowing a central organizing
committee to help coordinate, plan, and organize local Brainhack events all
around the world. Brainhack Global is composed of a volunteer team of
researchers from a variety of research institutions who lead global Brainhack
efforts annually. This team is in charge of designing the proceedings of
Brainhack Global, sharing information from Brainhack Global with individual
local hackathon efforts, and maintaining the Brainhack Global materials,
websites, and social accounts. Brainhack Global does not run a separate hacking
event themselves at any specific location or time, but instead shares the
information, materials, and broadcasts from all local event sites during the
defined event period each year.

### Brainhack Organization

The planning and coordination of a Brainhack event. This happens through the efforts of local teams and the Brainhack Global committee.

### Brainhack Organization Committee

The team of volunteers in charge of designing the proceedings of Brainhack Global, sharing information from Brainhack Global with individual local hackathon efforts, and maintaining the Brainhack Global materials, websites, and social accounts. The team can be reached via social platforms including twitter (https://twitter.com/brainhackorg) and mattermost (https://mattermost.brainhack.org/).

instead emphasize collaboration.

### Hacking

In this context, hacking does not refer to trying to break through the security

### Redistribution

Dissemination of something (e.g., information, duties) in a new way than what was done originally with the intention of increasing equality or fairness amongst individuals.

### Registered Report

A published report describing the hypotheses and planned method of a study,
before the data is collected. Also known as a ‘pre-registration’ or ‘pre-reg’.

### Reliability

Typically defined as the ratio of within-subject variability to between-subject
variability (ie. Intraclass correlation coefficient).

### Reporting Bias

Reporting bias occurs when certain aspects of a study are systematically not
reported transparently, creating wastage and redundancy through selective
reporting or non-publishing.

### Repository

The infrastructure and corresponding platform that allows for the persistent,
efficient and sustainable storage, maintenance and access of digital objects (e.g., resources including documents, data or code). This keyword is often
shortened to ‘repo’.

### Reproducible Research

Reproducibility is a spectrum and instructors should choose the definition most
used by their audience. Generally speaking, reproducible research makes it
possible to obtain similar results of a study or experiment and independent
results obtained with the same methods but under different conditions (i.e.,
pertains to results). Some break the definition into levels of reproducibility,
including computationally reproducible (also called "reproducible"): where code
and data can be analyzed in a similar manner as in the original research to
achieve the same results, and empirically reproducible (also called
“replicable”): where an independent researcher can repeat a study using the same
methods but creating new data.

### Reproducibility

The degree to which the same methods, results, and inferences of a study can be
produced again. Methods reproducibility is the degree to which the methods
described in a study report can be performed again. This may be limited by a
vague description in the study report or lack of openness in the data. Results
reproducibility is the degree to which the same results are produced, in a new
study with the same method Inferential reproducibility is the degree to which
the same inferences are drawn, either in a new study with the same method and
results or in a re-analysis of the original study. Generally speaking, when
discussing reproducibility it is important to specify the changing conditions
across which measurement/findings are being reproduced. Computational
reproducibility, cross-sample reproducibility, and cross-site reproducibility
and other forms all specify the changing conditions under which reproducibility
is being measured.

### Research Funder

An institute, corporation or government body that provides financial assistance
for research.

### Research Impact

Involve academic, economic and societal aspects, or some combination of all
three. Impact is the demonstrable contribution that research makes in shifting
understanding and advancing scientific, method, theory and application across
and within disciplines, and the broader role that this plays outside of the
research system.

### Reuse

## S

related to teaching, research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of
academics, scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research
findings so that they are available to the wider academic community. The
creation, transformation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge related
to teaching, research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of academics,

the original creator.

software demos with much narrower applications.

### Transparency

been applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of gatherings that try to avoid
hierarchical aspects of a conventional conference, such as sponsored
presentations and top-down organization {cite}`wiki:unconference`. Commonly,
participants present their research, project work, or any other topics of
current interest in an informal setting to other participants. The content of an
unconference is usually decided very shortly before or during the Brainhack
event itself, often inspired by ongoing within-team discussions that could be of
interest to the larger group.
