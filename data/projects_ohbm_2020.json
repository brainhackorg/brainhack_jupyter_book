A permanent place for hacking together.**\r\n\r\n**Team:**\r\nKatja, Roberto, Anibal, Remi, Isil, Austin, Sofie\r\nproject lead: katja\r\n\r\n**Timezone:**\r\nUTC+2\r\n(Paris, France)\r\n\r\n**Hub:**\r\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\n\r\nIn a team effort across continents, we recently created the [BrainWeb](https://brain-web.github.io), a permanent virtual space for online collaborations on projects related to neuroscience.\r\nIt has built so quickly a large community of >200 members, that this is the current community graph:\r\nhttps://brain-web.github.io/community/\r\n![BrainWeb_communityGraph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6297454/84762835-9c140100-afcb-11ea-9667-3ee8b87633a9.png)\r\n\r\nWe also have a a projects page  \r\n![BrainWeb_projects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-web/gazette/master/img/BrainWebGazette001.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd we now also host our own BrainWeb-jitsi for community calls, where we can send love \u2764\ufe0f  and brains \ud83e\udde0 , rockets \ud83d\ude80 and more love \ud83d\udc95 .\r\n<img width=\"671\" alt=\"BrainWeb_jitsi\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6297454/84790315-8285b000-aff1-11ea-95bb-f2021e8d469f.png\">\r\n\r\nNow how can we improve the BrainWeb? During this Hackathon, we would like to \r\n\r\n**1** add the possibility to filter the community graph by skills, so that we can easily find people to collaborate with \u2013 either based on shared interests or to add skills to our team that we are lacking\r\n\r\n**2** add all BrainWeb videoconference rooms in a sidebar on the page, and indicators of occupancy for all of them, like a green dot if there's someone in\r\n\r\n**3** add a posters room. The problem: How to improve the online poster room experience? How can we approach the stuff we miss from real poster rooms? Which are the new things we can have in a virtual, permanent, poster room? @katja showed a possibility that would be fun to explore, hacking MicroDraw.\r\n\r\n**4** by embedding jitsi in our videoconference tab, we have access to a shared data channel. We are currently using it to send emojis, but this is just a tiny starting point. We could use the data channel to synchronise quite sophisticated shared experiences! For example, a presenter could share a 3D brain (cf @dr.alecrimi)\r\n\r\nIf you'd love to work with us on the BrainWeb, join us on [Mattermost ~brainweb](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainweb), and find our [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/brain-web/brain-web.github.io).\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hacking with all of you! \ud83c\udf1e  \u2764\ufe0f \r\n\r\n",

This project intents to extends Connectome Mapper 3 to EEG. \r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/tree/ohbm-brainhack-2020\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: sebastientourbier\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n\r\n1. Creation of a sample BIDS dataset with EEG derivatives (computed inverse solutions):\r\n  - [x] Decide a sample dataset (open-source) to use (ultimately with T1w, DWI, rfMRI, EEG modality)\r\n  - [x] Organize the sample dataset according to BIDS MRI/EEG standard\r\n  - [x] EEG analysis (computes the inverse solution) by an open-source EEG analysis software such as MNE, EGGLab,... depending of the expertise in the team\r\n  - [ ] Organization of EEG analysis outputs into the derivatives of the dataset according to new derivatives specs introduced in BIDS 1.4.0 (https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/05-derivatives/01-introduction.html)\r\n\r\n2. Implementation of Nipype interfaces that:\r\n  - [ ] loads the inverse solutions and their respective x,y,z locations\r\n  - [ ] computes ROI source dipoles using the SVD technique\r\n  - [ ] computes single source dipoles per ROI based on SVD decomposition [Rubega et al. 2018] using pycartool (https://github.com/Functional-Brain-Mapping-Laboratory/PyCartool)\r\n  - [ ] computes diverse common functional connectivity metrics (Imaginary coherence, ...) using MNE - See how it integrates #203 \r\n\r\n3. Implementation of EEG pipeline in the Connectome Mapper 3\r\n  - [ ] Implementation of the EEG processing pipeline (`cmp/pipelines/functional/eeg.py`)\r\n  - [ ] Extension with graphical components (`cmp/bidsappmanager/pipelines/functional/eeg.py`)\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**: \r\n*  Get familiar to the Brain Imaging Data Structures: https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\r\n* Get familiar to the BIDS App framework: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005209\r\n* Get familiar with Nipype: https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/ \r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n* Brain Imaging Data Structure\r\n* EEG analysis\r\n* Nipype dataflow library\r\n\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**: https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-eeginsidecmp3\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**: https://meet.jit.si/EEGinsideCMP3\r\n\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n![Connectome Mapper 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connectomicslab/cmp3-ohbm2020/master/images/container_cmp3.png)\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

It was designed by Anisha Keshavan, PhD, et al, and inspired by the Tinder app. Scientists of any skill level can create an account and swipe left or right to judge an image as Pass or Fail. Each vote is recorded into a live online database that can be visualized for efficient data inclusion or exclusion in a study. While this platform can be simply leveraged by experts on a small scale to make the quality control process more efficient and organized it may also be used to crowd source quality control by \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d for large-scale datasets with proven accuracy that matches expert raters.\r\n\r\nWe have a unique opportunity at this OHBM Brainhack 2020 for you to both setup your own Swipes For Science site and to create exploratory data analysis tools with anonymized data collected from an existent Swipes For Science site. The dataset we\u2019ve included is for QC of outputs from the lightly modified DCAN Labs HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine answering questions like:\r\n- For all the images associated with one subject's data, should that entire subject be considered a Pass or Fail for inclusion in further analysis?\r\n- For all ratings provided by citizen scientist ABC, how reliably does ABC vote compared to the gold standard data?\r\n- Among all citizen scientists, who are the best raters?\r\n- What is the inter-rater reliability on image XYZ?\r\n- How can we use deep learning to align crowd sourced QC data with gold standard expert evaluation.\r\n... and more!\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/SwipesForScienceToolkit\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: `earl`\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**:\r\n\r\n1. Show interested contributors how to set up a SwipesForScience site\r\n2. Share with contributors anonymized data from our SwipesForScience site\r\n3. Create Exploratory Data Analysis Tools for SwipesForScience data\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n\r\n- Import data from JSON format and summarize in a digestible format like CSV.  \r\n- Report basic statistics on subjects and/or users.  \r\n- Visualize swipe data.  \r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n\r\nThe more you have beyond the below skills, the more you could do with the project:\r\n\r\n- (beginner) Data transformation (munging)\r\n- (beginner) Python\r\n- (beginner) Git/GitHub\r\n- (beginner) Data visualizations\r\n- (confirmed) Basic statistics (mean, variance, etc)\r\n- (barely) NPM/Vue/JavaScript/HTML/CSS\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**: https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-swipes\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n![Swipes For Science](images/SwipesForScience.png)\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

We ask you to register first over [here](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/HackathonReg/). Thank you!*\r\n\r\n*We have prepared a checklist to help with your project submission. Here is how to proceed:*\r\n 1. *Before filling in any part, please submit this issue*\r\n 2. *Check items in the checklist below as you go through them*\r\n 3. *Once you are done (at least all 'required' items must be provided), please delete the \"Guidelines\" section add a comment saying 'hi @ohbm/project-monitors: My project is ready!'*\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n*After step 1 (issue submitted), we will assign a 'project monitor' to follow your submission. If at any time you need help or anything is unclear, please add a comment and ping your project monitor. Our team is here to help!*\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n## Project info\r\n<!-- *Please fill this in first and then submit the issue* -->\r\n\r\n**Title**: Matching white matter fiber tracts across subjects \r\n<!--Name of your awesome project. Please also update the title of the issue to be the title of your project-->\r\n\r\n**Project lead**: Jinglei Lv (jinglei.lv(at)sydney.edu.au)\r\n<!--Your name and GitHub login, possibly more than 1 lead-->\r\n\r\n**[Timezone](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#timezone)**: Sydney time.\r\n<!--UTC offset of your timezone (cf. https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/ for example).-->\r\n\r\n**Hub**: Asian and Pacific hub.\r\n<!--Asia and Pacific / Europe, Middle East and Africa / The Americas based on location of project lead. Possibly more than 1 hub.-->\r\n\r\n**Description**: With diffusion MRI, we can track the axon fibers in the brain white matter. Although a certain level of variability exists, we still believe that there are a substantial amount of fiber bundles/tracts that are common across subjects. Thus, matching the fiber bundles across subjects could help us understand the common architecture of white matter in the human brain. The correspondence realized by the tract matching is beneficial for any tract-based statistics, e.g, FA on tract and functional connectivity on tract. \r\n\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/Jinglei-Lv/Matching-white-matter-fiber-tracts-across-subjects.git\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: jinglei.lv\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n1. Matching the fiber tracts generated by MRtrix 3 across subjects. \r\n2. Define the common fiber tracts and quantitatively measure individual variability.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n1. Find the the voxles/fixels that each fiber tract traverse.\r\n2. Match fibers by matching the traversed voxles/fixels.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n MRtrix file io/ coding with python/matlab\r\n**Chat channel**: https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-matching-fiber\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:  Please have a look at the mattermost channel (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, contact to @ jinglei.lv on Mattermost\r\n<!--\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n![pitch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16005941/84631363-95847b80-af30-11ea-9476-e07dfc38ba04.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

We ask you to register first over [here](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/HackathonReg/). Thank you!*\r\n\r\n*We have prepared a checklist to help with your project submission. Here is how to proceed:*\r\n 1. *Before filling in any part, please submit this issue*\r\n 2. *Check items in the checklist below as you go through them*\r\n 3. *Once you are done (at least all 'required' items must be provided), please delete the \"Guidelines\" section add a comment saying 'hi @ohbm/project-monitors: My project is ready!'*\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n*After step 1 (issue submitted), we will assign a 'project monitor' to follow your submission. If at any time you need help or anything is unclear, please add a comment and ping your project monitor. Our team is here to help!*\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n## Project info\r\n<!-- *Please fill this in first and then submit the issue* -->\r\n\r\n**Title**: Developing a modality-independent BIDS Connectivity data schema\r\n<!--Name of your awesome project. Please also update the title of the issue to be the title of your project-->\r\n\r\n**Project lead**: Eugene Duff (eduff), \r\n<!--Your name and GitHub login, possibly more than 1 lead-->\r\n\r\n**[Timezone](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#timezone)**:  London UTC+1\r\n<!--UTC offset of your timezone (cf. https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/ for example).-->\r\n\r\n**Hub**: Europe   , possibly Americas\r\n<!--Asia and Pacific / Europe, Middle East and Africa / The Americas based on location of project lead. Possibly more than 1 hub.-->\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\nThe Generic BIDS connectivity data schema is a BIDS proposal submitted to explore the development of standards for representing connectivity data BIDS derivative schemas across modalities.  This would enable easier integration of multimodal data in tools, and ease the expansion of BIDS to cover more modalities.  Now derivative schemas across more modalities are becoming more mature, and simpler elements of data representation have been addressed, now is a good time to review the status of connectivity data representation and determine what a \"meta\" schema might be able to provide in this context.\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugBdUF6dhElXdj3u9vw0iWjE6f_Bibsro3ah7sRV0GA/edit#heading=h.4xwnp2872y57\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n@eduff123\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n\r\n- Complete a thorough review of how connectivity is being implemented in other BIDS Derivatives to determine how common principles might be integrated or linked to a generic schema\r\n- To review and refine existing proposal for a BIDS Generic Connectivity Schema\r\n- To discuss whether there is a role for \"meta\" schemas in BIDS\r\n- To update the Schema implementation, web pages, and build an active team \r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n\r\n- Review schema document (possibly considering a specific modality as use case)\r\n- Begin document reviewing existing and potential BIDS connectivity schema\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n(none required)\r\n- experience with working with connectivity data\r\n- an interest in machine readable data schemas \r\n- an interest in visualisation of connectivity data\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-bids-connectivity\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-bids-connectivity) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @eduff123 on Mattermost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/902484/84585947-c4093600-ae0c-11ea-8011-e6210e8ddd78.png)Z\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [X] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [X] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

We ask you to register first over [here](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/HackathonReg/). Thank you!*\r\n\r\n*We have prepared a checklist to help with your project submission. Here is how to proceed:*\r\n 1. *Before filling in any part, please submit this issue*\r\n 2. *Check items in the checklist below as you go through them*\r\n 3. *Once you are done (at least all 'required' items must be provided), please delete the \"Guidelines\" section add a comment saying 'hi @ohbm/project-monitors: My project is ready!'*\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n*After step 1 (issue submitted), we will assign a 'project monitor' to follow your submission. If at any time you need help or anything is unclear, please add a comment and ping your project monitor. Our team is here to help!*\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n## Project info\r\n\r\n**mrpeek: a sixel-based terminal image viewer for MRtrix3**:\r\n\r\n**Project lead**: \r\n- J-Donald Tournier @jdtournier\r\n- Daan Christiaens @dchristiaens\r\n- Max Pietsch: @maxpietsch\r\n\r\n**[Timezone](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#timezone)**: London UTC+1\r\n\r\n**Hub**: Europe, Middle East and Africa\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\n\r\nDisplaying images on a remote server is very difficult / impossible currently using [MRtrix3](https://www.mrtrix.org/)'s `mrview`, due the incompatibility of OpenGL 3+ with X11 forwarding ([see here for details](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/remote-display-issues/2547)). It will be some time before the technology is updated to fix this. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, @wasserth's [niicat project](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/niicat) shows that it is possible to allow some (limited) display functionality using [sixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel). The [libsixel project](https://saitoha.github.io/libsixel/) provides an implementation that seems like a good starting point for a C++ command. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to create a simple command for interactive display of MR images within the terminal, build on the [MRtrix3](https://www.mrtrix.org/) codebase, so that it can be used for quick inspection of images both locally and remotely.\r\n\r\nIf successful, changes will be included in a future update to the MRtrix3 software. [Contributors](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be included in the built-in `git` [contribution statistics](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/graphs/contributors). We additionally credit contributors by showing their avatar at the bottom of the [_MRtrix3_ website front page](https://www.mrtrix.org/), and in the changelog as reported on the community forum ([example](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/mrtrix-3-0-rc3-3-0-0-changelog/3552)). \r\n\r\n**Link to project**: MRtrix3/mrtrix3#2079\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: jdtournier\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n\r\nThe range of possible milestones are presented in MRtrix3/mrtrix3#2079. The minimum requirements for the Hackathon would be: \r\n\r\n - extract a given slice of interest and render it to the terminal using libsixel\r\n- implement options or other user controls to select the slice of interest, projection (axial/sagittal/coronal), and brightness/control\r\n - implement real-time interaction based on keyboard input\r\n- implement real-time interaction based on mouse input\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n\r\n- [Install MRtrix3 from source](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/build_from_source.html) and set up an [external linked module](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tips_and_tricks/external_modules.html) to create your own app\r\n- build a simple MRtrix3 app that can loop over a single slice of an image and extract the intensities (inspired by e.g. MRtrix3's [mrcolour](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/blob/master/cmd/mrcolour.cpp))\r\n- install [libsixel](https://saitoha.github.io/libsixel/) and add it as a dependency to your project (by editing your `config` file if needed)\r\n- work out how to feed the image intensities from the input data in a format suitable for [libsixel](https://saitoha.github.io/libsixel/), and display to the terminal\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n\r\nSome experience with C++ is essential for this project. Experience with `git` and Unix in general would be advantageous. The pace of the project will however be tailored to the skillset of team members. No prior expectations are set on the quantity of team members.\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**: [hbmhack-mrpeek](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-mrpeek)\r\n\r\n**Video Channel** \r\n\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-mrpeek)(pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @jdtournier on Mattermost.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n![84496961-344d7580-acae-11ea-91c1-e51971b1e7d5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3221000/84586268-dfc20b80-ae0f-11ea-8129-d3e4e024caf9.png)\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

These are uncontrolled noises that are originated in updates of low-level libraries by third-party developers. \r\nIn practice, these numerical instabilities are caused by truncation and round-off errors due to \r\nthe precision limitation of the floating-point arithmetic.\r\nThe finite precision of the floating-point numbers leads to represent an approximation of \r\na real number that may be different on the computers with various precision formats.\r\n\r\nA possible method to investigate operating system related effects more comprehensively \r\nis to introduce controlled numerical perturbations in the math library functions (libmath), which could be done by introducing noise in floating-point computations through Monte-Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) using the Verificarlo tool. \r\n\r\nFor the hackathon we'll be looking to test the validity of the instrumented libmath library functions and also evaluate the stability of the existing neuroimaging pipelines.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/gkiar/fuzzy\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n@ali.salari, @gkiar, @valeriehayot, @yohan.chatelain\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nValidating the instrumented math functions and evaluating the stability of the FSL tool\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n1.

PyNets enables the user to specify any of a variety of methodological choices  impacting node and/or edge definition, and then sample the prescribed connectome estimates in a massively parallel framework that is conducive to predictive optimization (i.e. grid-search). PyNets is a post-processing workflow, which means that it can be run on virtually any preprocessed fMRI or dMRI data. It relies on Dipy, Nilearn, Networkx, and the Nipype workflow engine under-the-hood. It can now also be deployed as a BIDS application, where it takes BIDS derivatives and makes BIDS derivatives. \r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n<https://github.com/dPys/PyNets>\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n@dPys\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- This project is being included as a BrainHack project in preparation for its 1.0.0 official release before the end of June! I will be working on pushing integration testing and documentation/tutorials primarily throughout the week, but am very open working on any number of sub-project ideas as well (see below for examples).\r\n\r\n- Recruit new developers and co-authors, ensure all possible workflow combinations are bug-proof, and promote the technology more widely to researchers and students in the network neuroscience community.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Create a general-purpose function for robustly normalizing any atlas to a given brain template (without requiring the install of an additional dependency)\r\n- Jupyter notebooks with examples running the bids API with your own personal BIDS datasets. \r\n- Browser-based visualization fine-tuning (background with html/css/javascript preferred).\r\n- Unit tests!\r\n- Complete citation.py bibTex entries from docstring and configure duecredit decorators.\r\n\r\n**Good advanced issues**:\r\n- Multiplex graph theory / multigraph community detection.\r\n- Connectome topic modeling (I have a WIP that uses NiMare/Neurosynth and NLP that you can expand upon).\r\n- Converting FSL-based linear and non-linear registration wrappers to pure dipy (I have all the functions that you'd need).\r\n- Port any relevant utilities / general-purpose functions to Nilearn and Dipy wherever appropriate.\r\n- Re-wrap with Pydra.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\nAll skill levels, backgrounds, and perspectives welcome.\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n- hbmhack-pynets\r\n<https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-pynets>\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nMeetings will be conducted through jitsi.

Smith @Lestropie\r\n\r\n**[Timezone](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#timezone)**: UTC+10 (Australia east coast)\r\n\r\n**Hub**: Asia and Pacific\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\n\r\nThe challenge of automatically extracting a brain mask from neuroimaging data has attracted a lot of interest in the context of high-resolution anatomical-contrast data. Processing pipelines involving Diffusion MRI data commonly also require derivation of a brain mask. This has however not attracted the same development interest, despite regular feedback that this is regularly a point of failure for group studies.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve development of a generalised interface for derivation of DWI brain masks in the [*MRtrix3* software](https://www.mrtrix.org/). The [current \"`dwi2mask`\" binary command](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/commands/dwi2mask.html#dwi2mask) (written in C++) will be replaced with an interface implemented in Python, through which the user will have the ability to select from a range of different algorithms available for performing these tasks. Alternative approaches for DWI brain masking implemented in other software packages will be wrapped in order to provide access to all of these alternatives within a standardised interface, integrating compatibility with all of the image formats supported by *MRtrix3*.\r\n\r\nIf successful, changes will be included in a future update to the *MRtrix3* software. [Contributors](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be included in the built-in `git` [contribution statistics](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/graphs/contributors). We additionally credit contributors by showing their avatar at the bottom of the [*MRtrix3* website front page](https://www.mrtrix.org/), and in the changelog as reported on the community forum ([example](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/mrtrix-3-0-rc3-3-0-0-changelog/3552)). If there is [adequate test data](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/seeking-challenging-dwi-masking-data/3783) and differential performance between methods, a manuscript may be written reporting on the results of this analysis, on which all team members would be invited to contribute.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: MRtrix3/mrtrix3#2075\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @lestropie\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack** / **Good first issues**:\r\n\r\nThe range of possible milestones are presented in MRtrix3/mrtrix3#2075. The minimum requirements for the Hackathon would be: Re-implementation of existing *MRtrix3* `dwi2mask` C++ code in Python; wrapper algorithm for executing FSL's `bet` tool on the mean *b*=0 image; have both of these approaches available from a common interface.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n\r\nSome experience with Python, *MRtrix3* and/or `git` would be advantageous; the pace of the project will however be tailored to the skillset of team members. No prior expectations are set on the quantity of team members.\r\n\r\nGood entry points for starting with the project would be:\r\n\r\n- Install *MRtrix3* [from source](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/build_from_source.html)\r\n\r\n- Install FSL\r\n\r\n- Take a look at the *MRtrix3* [demonstration script code](https://github.com/MRtrix3/MRtrix3_demo_code/blob/master/bin/demo_script), as presented in the [*MRtrix3* manuscript](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811919307281).\r\n\r\n- Create a GitHub account if you have not done so already\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**: [hbmhack-dwi2mask](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-dwi2mask)\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:   https://us02web.zoom.us/j/6949814237  (password to be distributed via MatterMost)\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-06-14 10-48-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5637955/84582819-62f55880-ae34-11ea-8dc6-ffececea3e60.png)\r\n\r\n**Twitter-size summary**:\r\n\r\nDiffusion MRI brain masking (\"dwi2mask\")\r\nhttps://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues/2075\r\n@Lestropie\r\n#OHBMHackathon #Brainhack #OHBM2020\r\n\r\n## Project submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).\r\n-   [x] Goals for the OHBM Brainhack: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack. \r\n-   [x] Flesh out at least 2 \"good first issues\"\r\n-   [x] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. \r\n-   [x] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack. \r\n-   [x] Video channel: Zoom personal meeting to be used; password to be made available at commencement of hackathon\r\n-   [x] Provide an image of your project for the OHBM brainhack website.\r\n\r\nYou can also include information about (all optional):\r\n-   [x] Number of participants, cf.

Datasets are uniformly described using the Data Tags Suite ([DATS](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/9/2/giz165/5730051)), available for download through [DataLad ](http://www.datalad.org), regularly monitored using [CircleCI](http://circleci.com), and searchable through the CONP web portal. The data itself remains under the control of its owners, as it can be stored in various backends including [LORIS](http://loris.ca), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), the [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io), or any other backend supported by DataLad (http, ftp, etc).

Possibly more than 1 hub.-->\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\n[Physiopy](https://github.com/physiopy) is a github organisation maintained by (at the moment) 12 volunteers that aims to offer open development solutions for physiology in MRI.\r\n[`phys2bids`](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids) is the flagship library of physiopy, and consists in a python3 library meant to format physiological (cardiac, respiratory, or gas signals) files in BIDS. It was born for AcqKnowledge (BIOPAC) files, and at the moment it also supports LabChart (ADInstruments). It doesn\u2019t support physiological files recorded with the MRI (yet).\r\nNext to `phys2bids`, we\u2019re starting the development of [`phys2denoise`](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2denoise), a library dedicated to prepare physiological signal for fMRI denoising.\r\n\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @smoia\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nWe have different proposals for Brainhack participants, that can be seen [here](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids/milestone/5).\r\nBetween the contributors, we have very different background, but one that is lacking is knowledge in pattern recognition or ML. We\u2019d be thrilled if someone that has experience in that field could help us set up an automatic recognition of the file contents!\r\nWe would also like to start supporting eyetracking bidsification, so if anyone with background (and recordings) in eyetracking wants to help out, it would be a great opportunity to work together.\r\nWe\u2019re always looking forward for collaboration with other bidsificators. At the moment, we\u2019re working together with  `bidscoin` to integrate the two solutions together, and we\u2019d be happy to start a dialogue with `heudiconv` contributors and other bidsificators too!\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\nSee them [here](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids/labels/Good%20first%20issue)\r\n\r\n**Skills**: Depending on the issue that you want to tackle!\r\n\r\n- Good First Issues: willingness to learn python/git/github/restructured text. We\u2019ll help you out with those!\r\n- Automatic recognition of physiological signal: knowledge of pattern recognition in python is welcomed.\r\n- Eyetracking integration: knowledge of eye tracking (python knowledge not necessary).\r\n- Making a report for phys2bids: interest in design or UI/UX or web design skills.\r\n- If you\u2019re a BIDS expert, we\u2019d love to have a chat with you!\r\n- Other required skills are described in the issues themselves.\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:  [#hbmhack-physiopy](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/physiopy)\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video channel**: will be provided in the mattermost channel.\r\n<!--\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\nhttps://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids/blob/master/docs/_static/phys2bids_card.jpg\r\n\r\n**Contribution recognition**: We follow all-contributors specifications!

The schema allows internationalization (multiple languages), is implementation agnostic, and tracks variations in assessments (e.g., PHQ-9, PHQ-8).\r\nThis open and accessible schema library with appropriate conversion (e.g., to RedCap) and data collection tools (e.g., MindLogger, LORIS, RedCap) enables more consistent acquisition across projects, with results being harmonized by design.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui\r\nhttps://github.com/sensein/voice-backend\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @sanuann\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- reproschema-starter-kit (non-coding)\r\n- adding new/verifying activities (non-coding)\r\n- adding new languages (non-coding)\r\n- validation library (requires coding)\r\n- create dashboard for collected results (requires coding)\r\n- improve schema-ui widgets (requires coding)\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema/issues/371\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema/issues/377\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui/issues/141\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui/issues/129\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui/issues/125\r\nand more.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- documentation, git\r\n- JSON-LD, SHACL\r\n- vuejs, javascript, python\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-reproschema\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-reproschema) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @sanuann on Mattermost.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

Ideally, you set scan acquisition parameters in preparation for BIDS, but mistakes will be made.  Non-ideally, you have an old set of scans you want to BIDSify.  Wouldn't it be great if you could \"see\" the entire situation so you can easily locate and understand the problems?  Wouldn't you like this picture to come alive to help you curate your data?\r\n\r\n![DICOM folders to BIDS hierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndysWorth/BIDS-Curation-GUI/master/img/BIDS_GUI.png)\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/AndysWorth/BIDS-Curation-GUI\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-bids-gui\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n* Find out how a GUI can help understand and detect errors in BIDS curation.\r\n* Learn new skills\r\n* Contribute to reproducible research\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n* Refine project goals and technology to use\r\n* Establish basic GUI using [React](https://reactjs.org/)\r\n* Establish basic workflow based on [ReproIn](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin#reproin), [HeuDiConv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv#heudiconv), and the [BIDS-Validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#bids-validator)\r\n* Create project logo\r\n* Initial artwork for the GUI\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n* BIDS, Python, Docker, git\r\n* [React](https://reactjs.org/), JavaScript\r\n* Familiarity with MRI data acquisition and how it can go wrong.\r\n* Graphic design\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-bids-gui\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

Possibly more than 1 hub.-->\r\n\r\n**Description**: \r\n\r\nThe project aims to create a user-friendly python tool allowing the BIDS group to select, search, or add BIDS specification terms and export a PDF table of the chosen BIDS term along with appropriate term properties and instructions on adding new terms. If the user chooses to add a new term, the tool will create and export a new BIDS specification term as a JSON-LD file and push it to our [terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/tree/master/terms/BIDS_Terms) repository where discussion surrounding the new term can be captured using git/github. Such an effort will provide the BIDS working group with a user-friendly tool to build tables for the BIDS documentation while ensuring they have not re-purposed an existing BIDS specification term giving it conflicting definitions.  For additional information on the background for this project see BIDS specification [issue 423](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/423).\r\n\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/nqueder/bids_terms_to_pdf_table\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @nazek.queder\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n\r\n* Create a Python-based tool allowing users to specify subsets of [BIDS specification terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/tree/master/terms/BIDS_Terms) and properties of those terms to include in a PDF-formatted table for inclusion into specifications.\r\n* Create JSON-LD files for newly added BIDS specification terms.\r\n* Creating a document with clear instructions for the user on how to use our tool.\r\n* Create an automated way to push newly created JSON-LD files to the [Interlex](https://scicrunch.org/nidm-terms) information resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n* Create a [Scicrunch](https://scicrunch.org/nidm-terms) account and generate a new Interlex API key, for instructions on how to generate an Interlex API key please visit our [github repository](https://github.com/nqueder/bids_terms_to_pdf_table).\r\n* Review the BIDS specification documents and our [NIDM-Terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms) repository and get familiar with our current group of [BIDS terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/tree/master/terms/BIDS_Terms).\r\n\r\n**Skills**: \r\n\r\n* Python \r\n* Data query\r\n* Git - any level\r\n* BIDS - Brain Imaging Data Structure\r\n* Knowledge about JSON and JSON-LD is recommended but not required\r\n* Someone who knows how to develop good, tidy and clear documentation for developing clear and well structured user\u2019s instructions\r\n* Someone with good research and document analysis skills\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:  https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm_bids-terms-to-pdf\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video Channel:** \r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm_bids-terms-to-pdf) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @nazek.queder on Mattermost.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**: A link to our Zoom meeting room will be provided as a pinned message in the [chat channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm_bids-terms-to-pdf)\r\n\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website** \r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

Containers can be run both interactively (e.g., within a Virtual Machine on the cloud) and in batch processing (e.g., on HPC), thus contributing to reproducibility across stages of the analysis. The goal of this project is to generate a \"virtual neuro machine\" container, i.e. a large container that includes most popular neuroimaging tools, and can be used as a stand-alone VM. Although tools to generate neuroimaging software containers are already in place (e.g., neurodocker), continued maintenance of such a large container with complex library dependencies requires in-built testing capabilities, and especially so, of included GUI applications. This project will bring together people working on different environments and using different neuroimaging tools, in order to: 1) build a working container with the newest software versions available in June 2020, 2) develop in-built testing capabilities, to facilitate future container upgrades, 3) develop a standard \"home screen\" for the container, to provide common interface across host environments.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/NeuroDesk\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\norenciv\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n1) build a working container with the newest software versions available in June 2020\r\n2) have a routine for testing the container on an OpenStack virtual machine accessed via VNC\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n1) choose a tool to test graphical applications running within a container\r\n2) identify built-in testing routines provided by each of the main neuroimaging tools\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n1) neurodocker (https://github.com/ReproNim/neurodocker), or equivalent tools (recommendations would be appreciated)\r\n2) docker\r\n3) singularity\r\n4) expertise in neuroimaging packages included in neurodocker\r\n5) expertise in graphical design (to design a \"home screen\" for the container, as graphical desktops cannot be easily containarised)\r\n6) expertise in GUI development for Linux (any language)\r\n7) continous integration (CI) for containers\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/virtual-neuro-machine-vnm\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the mattermost channel (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, email orenciv@gmail.com\r\n\r\n**Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website**:\r\n   title: \"Virtual Neuro Machine (VNM)\"\r\n   image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18NiPnrzK3ylPKjiXOJyuP8eBTSZ4ic1D/view\r\n   details: \"With the advent of container technology, cumbersome virtual machines have been reduced to a single container file that can be easily run on multiple-environments.

Please also update the title of the issue to be the title of your project-->\r\n\r\n**Project lead**: [Sina Mansour L.](https://github.com/sina-mansour) and [Ye Tian](https://github.com/yetianmed) (@sina-mansour and @yetianmed)\r\n\r\n**Timezone**: Melbourne UTC+10\r\n\r\n**Hub**: Asia and Pacific\r\n\r\n**Description**: \r\n\r\nEmerging evidence suggests the outstanding utility of multimodal neuroimaging data in predicting individual variation in age and cognition. However, it is unclear whether the predictive utility of such measures is a global effect or is consistently attributed to certain localized patterns of brain structure and connectivity.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to evaluate and develop an analysis framework for optimal performance of age and behavior (e.g. fluid intelligence) prediction using measures of brain structure and connectivity. The goal is to achieve both overall high prediction accuracy in cross-validated samples and high consistency in the estimated predictors (e.g. regions/connections) if possible. A secondary aim of the project is to investigate the potential markers of sub-clinical cognitive decline through simultaneous prediction of age and cognition in a healthy adult cohort.\r\n\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: [2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: `sina_mansour_l` and `yetian`\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**: Collecting implementations of machine learning models to predict age and cognition. This will be followed by a future evaluation of prediction accuracy and feature selection consistency in prediction models of age and IQ using multimodal neuroimaging dataset.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\nStep 1: [Clone the repository](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project/-/issues/1)\r\nStep 2: [Join our chat channel](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project/-/issues/2)\r\nStep 3: [Register your team](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project/-/issues/new?issuable_template=register_team)\r\nStep 4: Start coding :)\r\n\r\n**Skills**: General knowledge about neuroimaging modalities, neuropsychology, and familiarity with a programming language (Python, Matlab, or any language you prefer :wink: )\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**: [mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainhack-ml](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainhack-ml)\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the mattermost channel to know the video channel.\r\n\r\n**Participant capacity**: We look forward to maximum participation from the neuroimaging community. There is no limit to the number of participants, we will try our best to provide static information, and build an FAQ system to ensure we can provide feedback to participants.\r\n\r\n**Contributions**: All contributors (participants and teams) will be listed in [our public repository](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project/-/tree/master). After post hoc evaluations of the models, participants submitting well-performing models will be contacted for future collaboration on potential publications.\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

Software to do Y?_, we hope that this project will answer your question.\r\n\r\nWe use [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification and we have a [contribution guide](https://github.com/learn-neuroimaging/tutorials-and-resources/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) that can evolve during the Hackathon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have currently a project board (https://github.com/learn-neuroimaging/tutorials-and-resources/projects/1).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"tutorial-and-resources\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24808663/84604001-48060100-ae93-11ea-9838-1f4f931c2e77.png\">\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/learn-neuroimaging/tutorials-and-resources\r\nhttps://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/tutorials-and-resources/\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n[@alexandre.routier](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/messages/@alexandre.routier)\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nA previous Hackathon in April (via [BrainWeb](https://brain-web.github.io/#events)) lead to a new Website (https://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/tutorials-and-resources/) with a proposition of guide.\r\n\r\nImprovements regarding its content and missing sections will be planned during this 3-day hackathon. Automatic update of the website when new content is added will be also planned. Currently, website is presented as a guide. If we have geeky contributors, we can investigate how to render the website as a database so that any new user can easily search information through keywords.\r\n\r\nDepending on the role assignment, around 5 participants would be comfortable to accelerate this project.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Add new content (e.g. new MEG Software, new Statistics course) using pre-filled [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/learn-neuroimaging/tutorials-and-resources/issues/new/choose) or Pull Requests.\r\n- Review content of the current website and/or new contribution via Pull Request\r\n- Convert pages following \"old\" template (like [MRI Software](https://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/tutorials-and-resources/analysis_software_MRI/)) to \"new\" template (like [Data repositories](https://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/tutorials-and-resources/data-repositories/))\r\n- Automatically update the website when new content is merged into GitHub\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- A certain love for lists and data curation.\r\n- Review content though website and/or Pull Request.\r\n- Minimal knowledge of Markdown.\r\n- Minimal knowledge of Git / GitHub will be very appreciated. It is a good opportunity to follow the [Git / GitHub course](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/schedule/emea#undefined) that will be done on the first day\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n[~hbm-tuto_&_resources](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/tutorial-and-resources)\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/tutorial-and-resources) to know the video channel.\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [X] Link to your project\r\n-   [X] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).\r\n-   [X] Goals for the OHBM Brainhack: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack.\r\n-   [X] Flesh out at least 2 \"good first issues\": those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-2-good-first-issues).\r\n-   [X] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project.

My vision now is to make it become the Swiss Army Knife for tractography: a tool able to try out things, even when you do not have the right software installed (!!!). The dream would be typing just \"trampolino --corpus-callosum\" and getting the tractogram for a corpus callosum to play with!\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/matteomancini/trampolino\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @matman\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- truly making TRAMPOLINO feels like a Swiss Army Knife!\r\n- \"just do it\" arguments - to get immediately a tractogram to try stuff (e.g.: just typing \"trampolino -track\" would return a whole brain tractography for a sample subject);\r\n- option to run workflows in containers;\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- write a script to easily retrieve public dataset;\r\n- implement tractography format conversions (e.g. .tck->.trk);\r\n- write Nipype workflows and/or interfaces for Diffusion Toolkit ODFs and Trekker;\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- Python;\r\n- Interest in tractography;\r\n- Nipype and Click packages (useful skill but not necessary);\r\n- Some experience with any existing tractography package would be a plus;\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**: [hbmhack-trampolino](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-trampolino)\r\n\r\n**Video channel**: \r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-trampolino) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @matman on Mattermost.\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

However various bidsificators  target only one or two modalities. \r\n\r\nBidsme project has been developed to provide a bidsificator as universal as possible, both in modalities and data formats. The project is based on two main ideas: \r\n\r\n- everything that is laboratory-depending (log files, events, demographic info, psychological assessments, format conversions) must be treated via plugins\r\n- Data treated in object-oriented way: master class do the bidsifications, modality sub-class defines the BIDS-related parameters (entities, JSON fields etc...), data-format sub-sub-class implements how to read metadata\r\n\r\nUsing this approach it is possible to integrate a new modality from scratch in one week, and fully create plugins for a given dataset in few days.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n[https://github.com/CyclotronResearchCentre/bidsme](https://github.com/CyclotronResearchCentre/bidsme)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\nnbeliy\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nThe minimum program is to get some long-term collaborators, for now it is one man project, but it becomes too big to be handled alone.\r\n\r\nProgram maximum is to implement few new modalities, namely MEG, probably create a neat GUI. \r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n\r\n- Incorporate MEG and most popular corresponding data formats\r\n- Rework how sidecar JSON file are created and filled\r\n- Improve plugin framework\r\n- Incorporate bidsified dataset versioning\r\n- Incorporate checks for dataset completeness\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n\r\n| Language                   | Level |\r\n| ----------------------------- | ----------|\r\n| Python3                      | confirmed |\r\n| Unix command line    | beginner |\r\n\r\nAdvanced Python3 skills, with understanding of object-oriented programming, including virtual functions\r\n\r\nIf working on modality, knowledge of such modality, corresponding BIDS section and knowledge of data format\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n[Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bidsme-brainhack)\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bidsme-brainhack) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @nbeliy.\r\n\r\n<!--Some [jitsi meet](https://meet.jit.si/) room when it will be set-up.!-->\r\n\r\n**Slides for project pitch**\r\n[bidsme.pdf](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/files/4778935/bidsme.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

If at any time you need help or anything is unclear, please add a comment and ping your project monitor. Our team is here to help!*\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n## Project info\r\n<!-- *Please fill this in first and then submit the issue* -->\r\n\r\n**Title**: git-annex special remote for the open science framework\r\n\r\n**Project lead**: Adina Wagner, @adswa\r\n\r\n**[Timezone](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#timezone)**: UTC+2\r\n\r\n**Hub**: Europe, Middle East and Africa\r\n\r\n**Description**: \r\nThe [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) is an amazing infrastructure for open science. In this project, we attempt to create a [git-annex special remote](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/) implementation to leverage OSF filestorage and make the data storing that OSF provides even more useful. The git-annex OFS special remote would allow to transform OSF storage into git-annex repositories. Files in OSF storage could thus be consumed or exported fast and easily via git-annex or [datalad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad), and published to repository-hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, ...) as lightweight repositories that constitute an alternative access to the data stored on the OSF - that is: you can ``git clone`` a repository from for example GitHub and ``get`` the data from the OSF from the command line or in your scripts.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/adswa/git-annex-remote-osf\r\nThere is no code yet - we will assemble a group of interested Brainhackers and start from scratch\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: adina\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- Familiarize ourselves with git-annex's concept of special remotes\r\n- Explore the [OSF API ](https://developer.osf.io/#tag/Introduction) and [OSF's waterbutler](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/waterbutler) to interact with OSF's various supported file storage services\r\n- Get started with a Python-based special-remote implementation\r\n- Set up appropriate documentation\r\n- Short term goal: export and import data from public OSF projects from and into git-annex repositories\r\n- Nice-to-have's/Long(er) term development goals: Extend functionality to private repositories (requires token-based authentication)\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Set up the [allcontributors-bot](https://allcontributors.org/) in the project repository to acknowledge contributions\r\n- Create a public and a private project on the Open Science Framework for us to play with. The more comprehensive this task is carried out, the better. Here's a sketch: Add (any) data (honestly, any - cat content, your favorite recipe, a funny video, ...) to different storage providers (OSFStorage, GDrive, Dropbox, ...) to a public and a private repository on the OSF. Make sure that some data exists in a single version, but also take data and update it with a modified version, using the [OSF's version control features](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738694-file-revisions-and-version-control).\r\n\r\nYou can find more **good first issues** in the project repository: https://github.com/adswa/git-annex-remote-osf/issues :hugs:\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- **Technical writing**: Good user documentation is essential. Depending on what you are interested to do this could take the form of a README, a [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) or [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)-based technical documentation, tutorials, a usecase in the [DataLad handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/), or anything else that you can think of.\r\n- **Experience with the Open Science Framework**: If you are a user of the Open Science Framework, let us know how you use it, walk us through a public project of yours, provide us with projects to use for testing, your ideas and needs,  ... If you have used the OSF then you will be a great help!\r\n- **Python programming**: We aim for a special remote implementation in Python. There are [good templates](https://github.com/Lykos153/AnnexRemote) and [many](https://github.com/CONP-PCNO/git-annex-remote-globus) [examples](https://github.com/Lykos153/git-annex-remote-googledrive) that we will use and learn from along the way.\r\n- **Interest in git-annex or experience with it**: We are looking for git-annex experts and novices alike - and everything in between. If you saw \"git-annex\" and thought \"uuhhhh, interesting :thinking:\" then come get on board!\r\n- **Knowledge about HTTP requests/authentication**\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/git-annex-osf\r\n\r\n**Video channel**\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/git-annex-osf) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @adswa.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- **Video channel**:\r\nhttps://meet.jit.si/git-annex-osf -->\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

Some problems with this training a) the tools need to be easy to access and setup (e.g. wearable); b) the feedback should be engaging and ideally involving multiple senses (e.g. visual, auditory, 3D, aromas); and c) the feedback should be based on both brain waves (EEG) and other indicators (e.g. body motion, heart rate, breathing rate) to provide richer self-understanding. \r\n*Problem:* Develop an app for use with a wearable neurofeedback system (e.g. Muse, Emotiv, OpenBCI) that provides richer environmental feedback and/or sensing to better serve the ADHD, PTSD or generalized anxiety pediatric populations.\r\n*Further information:*Neurofeedback uses operant learning/conditioning to train the brain to optimize its function; in essence it\u2019s a form of \u201crebalancing\u201d of brain function depending on the protocols used. A simple neurofeedback system utilizes SMR rhythm and alpha frequencies to focus and calm the mind. When the brain learns to mimic the frequencies and maintain those patterns it rewarded. Reward schedules are changed to increase the brains ability to hold the \u201cnew\u201d normal/equilibrium, which over time teaches the brain to maintain a \u201cnew\u201d or previous \u201cnormal\u201d (equilibrium). Many people use it for all sorts of conditions as well as to increase performance. People who are out of touch with their feelings or body sensations (e.g. heart rate) would benefit from a non-invasive, self-directed way to become aware of and gain control of these functions. This could help them to realize the benefit of consistently and achieving their set goals. There is also a need to provide visual data to both the client and the clinician tracking changes and measuring success or problem areas.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-multimod-nf\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\nhbmhack-multimod-nf\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nResearch potential avenues to address the problem with existing technologies and design a prototype that would address shortcomings. Depending on skillset of team members, hack a script or app that may begin to demonstrate solutions to some of the identified problems with existing solutions.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- **Video channel**:   -->\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [ ] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [ ] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).
