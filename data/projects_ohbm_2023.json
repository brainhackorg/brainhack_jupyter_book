However, it's unclear the best approaches to model data longitudinally, given that the gold standard is often unclear. Thus, the goal of this project is for several different groups to generate longitudinal simulated data with embedding aspects of typical and atypical brain development into the the code. Initially, the plan is that the data will be released and after approximately one year, the code with the data will be released. This will allow different groups to assess the code. \n\n### Link to the Project\n\nhttps://github.com/tonyajohansonwhite/LongSim\n\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\n\n_No response_\n\n### Project lead\n\nTonya White\r\nGithub login: tonyajohansonwhite\r\n\n\n### Main Hub\n\nMontreal\n\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\n\n- [X] Montreal\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\n- [ ] Americas\n\n### Skills\n\nBrian development, coding, neuroimaging \n\n### Recommended tutorials for new contributors\n\n- [ ] [Set up a brainhack friendly computing environment](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/installation/)\n- [ ] [A introduction to Bash](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/introduction_to_terminal/)\n- [X] [Python: Writing a script](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_scripts/)\n- [X] [Python: Data analysis with Python](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_data_analysis/)\n- [ ] [Python: Visualisation](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_visualization/)\n- [ ] [Machine learning basics](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_basics/)\n- [ ] [BIDS](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/bids/)\n- [ ] [Machine learning for neuroimaging](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_neuroimaging/)\n- [ ] [VCS: Using Git and Github](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/git_github/)\n- [ ] [VCS: Data management with Datalad](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/datalad/)\n- [ ] [Virtualization](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/containers/)\n- [ ] High Performance Computing: [Oracle cloud resource](https://brainhack.org/brainhack_cloud/)\n\n### Good first issues\n\nall invited\n\n### Twitter summary\n\nnot written yet. \n\n### Short name for the Discord chat channel (~15 chars)\n\nLongSim\n\n### Please read and follow the OHBM Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow the OHBM Code of Conduct during the hackathon",

We develop an approach, called mode-based morphometry (MBM), that can be used to describe any empirical map of anatomical variations in terms of the fundamental, resonant modes\u2013\u2013eigenmodes\u2013\u2013of brain anatomy. This approach naturally yields a multiscale characterization of the empirical map, affording new opportunities for investigating the spatial frequency content of neuroanatomical variability.\r\n\r\nWe have developed a toolbox for this approach in Matlab. Depending on the expertise of participants, our goals for BrainHack are to make the toolbox more user-friendly, add more features, and translate it to Python.\n\n### Link to the Project\n\nhttps://github.com/NSBLab/MBM\n\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\n\n_No response_\n\n### Project lead\n\nName: Trang Cao\r\nGitHub: https://github.com/NSBLab\r\nDiscord: trangcao.\n\n### Main Hub\n\nMontreal\n\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\n\n- [ ] Montreal\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\n- [ ] Americas\n\n### Skills\n\nCoding skills\r\nThey will be tasks for different skills ranging from just starting coding on Matlab, wanting to try GUI on Matlab, to Premier League.

The metadata can be searched here: https://query.neurobagel.org/ \r\n\r\nWe are going to work on two projects for folks at any level of experience. Our goals are:\r\n\r\n- **Understand better how users want to interact with our tools**. Sit down with us, try the query tool or our \"Getting started\" documentation, and tell us what is easy and what can be improved. We specifically want to hear from people who are interested in a cross-dataset cohort search about how they would like to use Neurobagel in the future.\r\n- **Increase alignment with the BIDS community**. Neurobagel annotations are currently stored inside BIDS `participant.json` files [with additional json keys](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets-JSONLD/ds004393/blob/e2117828736d09df96e911a1b4327f5f21afe7a6/participants.json#L26-L42). We would like to discuss how we can create these files in a way that makes them maximally useful to people in the wider BIDS ecosystem, and hopefully eventually fully BIDS compatible.\r\n- **Collaborate on automating the processing of OpenNeuro annotations**. We would like to have an automatic process that can be triggered (e.g. via some Github Action or hook) to pull a BIDS datalad dataset and run the Neurobagel metadata extractor to create a linked data view of the BIDS dataset that we can search over. All of the steps are already in place but done manually at the moment. We hope to find ways to automate this via Github or a different CI.\r\n\r\n### Link to the Project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neurobagel\r\n\r\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Project lead\r\n\r\n| Who             | Where      | Github     | Discord |\r\n|-----------------|------------|------------|---------|\r\n| Alyssa Dai      | In person  | @alyssadai | alyssadai#5780        |\r\n| Arman Jahanpour | On Discord | @rmanaem   | rmanaem        |\r\n| Sebastian Urchs | In person  | @surchs    | _surchs |\r\n\r\n### Main Hub\r\n\r\nMontreal\r\n\r\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\r\n\r\n- [X] Montreal\r\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\r\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\r\n- [ ] Americas\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\nUser feedback\r\n- everybody is welcome\r\n- having an interest in cross dataset cohort search or dealing with messy data\r\n\r\nDiscussing semantic annotation in BIDS\r\n- BIDS (beginner)\r\n- Experience working with messy (clinical) data\r\n- Research interest that wants to ask questions across several dataset\r\n- Interest in data harmonization and metadata\r\n\r\nAutomating processing of OpenNeuro metadata\r\n- Datalad\r\n- git, Github Actions, CI workflows in general\r\n- Python\r\n- Docker (nice to have)\r\n\r\n### Recommended tutorials for new contributors\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Set up a brainhack friendly computing environment](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/installation/)\r\n- [ ] [A introduction to Bash](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/introduction_to_terminal/)\r\n- [ ] [Python: Writing a script](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_scripts/)\r\n- [ ] [Python: Data analysis with Python](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_data_analysis/)\r\n- [ ] [Python: Visualisation](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_visualization/)\r\n- [ ] [Machine learning basics](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_basics/)\r\n- [X] [BIDS](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/bids/)\r\n- [ ] [Machine learning for neuroimaging](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_neuroimaging/)\r\n- [X] [VCS: Using Git and Github](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/git_github/)\r\n- [X] [VCS: Data management with Datalad](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/datalad/)\r\n- [X] [Virtualization](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/containers/)\r\n- [ ] High Performance Computing: [Oracle cloud resource](https://brainhack.org/brainhack_cloud/)\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Twitter summary\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Short name for the Discord chat channel (~15 chars)\r\n\r\nneurobagel\r\n\r\n### Please read and follow the OHBM Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the OHBM Code of Conduct during the hackathon",

Continuing on that line, we recently released MRIQC with beta support for dMRI data. dMRIPrep has long been in the works, and we expect to make progress on this front too. Finally, we may delve into the eddymotion project with the implementation of a Gaussian Process model for eddymotion, thereby enhancing the dMRIPrep preprocessing pipeline's capability to handle motion-related artifacts.\r\nTherefore, we are planning to act on the following lines, depending on the appetite and preferences of brain hackers\r\n- MRIQC \r\n    - improving the reportlets of the visual reports, including color FA, anisotropic power map, and/or carpetplot.\r\n- eddymotion \r\n    - developing new models for diffusion and PET data:\r\n    - Gaussian Process model to allow comparison vs. FSL topup (this line is most likely to directly contribute to DIPY).\r\n    - PET model (continuing with the work initiated in the 2022 hackathon at OHBM Glasgow)\r\n- dMRIPrep \r\n    - pipeline, package and containers makeover\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nipreps/mriqc\r\nhttps://github.com/nipreps/eddymotion\r\nhttps://github.com/nipreps/dmriprep\r\n\r\n\n\n### Link to the Project\n\nhttps://github.com/nipreps\n\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\n\n_No response_\n\n### Project lead\n\nAriel rokem (GitHub: @arokem, Discord: @arokem) and Teresa Gomez (Github: @teresamg)\n\n### Main Hub\n\nMontreal\n\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\n\n- [ ] Montreal\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\n- [ ] Americas\n\n### Skills\n\nWhile we encourage participants of all skill levels to join, a good understanding of Python is recommended to contribute to this project.

While these insights can be described in conventional PDF papers, many other aspects of researchers' work often do not go through a similar publication procedure, lacking peer review and full citability. These research outputs, collectively known as _research objects_, hold significant value for the neuroimaging community. \r\nExamples of such research objects include:\r\n\r\n- Code\r\n- Code wrappers\r\n- Pipelines\r\n- Toolboxes\r\n- Toolbox plugins\r\n- Code notebooks\r\n\r\nAlthough these research objects are typically not subject to peer review and are not indexed in standardized publication systems, they deserve to be citable in a manner that recognizes the author's contribution and aids in the assessment of their scholarly impact, such as their h-index.\r\n\r\nIn a special initiative, Aperture Neuro wants to invite members of the neuroimaging community to submit their research objects in the form of code.\r\n\r\nThis invitation is specifically aimed to code that fulfills the following criteria: \r\n\r\n- High quality\r\n- Open\r\n- Useful to the community\r\n- Not previously published as a peer-review paper\r\n\r\nThe goal of this hackathon project is to: \r\n\r\n- [ ] Identify codes that are used in the field of neuroimaging but are not citable via PubMed listed publications.\r\n- [ ] Build a database of code repositories that are widely used.

        "body": "### Title\r\n\r\nCiftiPy\r\n\r\n### Short description and the goals for the OHBM BrainHack\r\n\r\n`cifti` is a neuroimaging file format that flexibly stores vertex and voxel data in the same file. It's the format of choice in the HCP processing pipelines for storing surface maps, but can also be used for cortical parcellations, brain segmentations, structural and functional connectomes, and many other applications.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there isn't an easy way to handle this format in python. Nibabel has support, but the interface is unintuitive and bulky.\r\n\r\nCiftiPy will be a wrapper around nibabel offering a convenient, numpy-based interface for accessing and manipulating cifti files. It will offer convenient methods for indexing cifti files by data-type, structure, and hemisphere, be easily and transparently viewed in an REPL (like pandas or xarray), and offer methods for common tasks.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nNo code has been written yet, but we have a fairly clear plan for the API. The goal will be to implement, test, and document the core interfaces.\r\n\r\n## Long term\r\n\r\nWe are prioritizing robustness over number of features, so we're purposefully trying to keep the scope as small as possible. If we get a good cifti interface built, however, it could in principle be extended to support other neuroimaging file types (gifti, nifti), resulting in a generalized, user-friendly nibabel wrapper.\r\n\r\n### Link to the Project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pvandyken/ciftipy\r\n\r\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Project lead\r\n\r\nPeter Van Dyken - pvandyken#9542\r\nMohamed Yousif - dunnom8#1502\r\nMauricio Cespedes Tenorio - mau_cespedes99#7386\r\n\r\n### Main Hub\r\n\r\nMontreal\r\n\r\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\r\n\r\n- [ ] Montreal\r\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\r\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\r\n- [ ] Americas\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n(Any and none of these skills are welcome!

ICA-AROMA, on the other hand, is a data-driven method that automatically identifies and removes motion-related independent components from fMRI data.\r\nPrior to fMRIPrep 23.1, ICA-AROMA was an optional component of fMRIPrep, but it was removed as being out-of-scope, as it can be performed on fMRIPrep outputs.\r\nThe project focuses on creating an ICA-AROMA pipeline that accepts fMRIPrep outputs as its inputs, in particular MNI152NLin6Asym-resampled BOLD series. The pipeline will apply SUSAN smoothing, run MELODIC, and finally ICA-AROMA. The pipeline will provide options for users to select specific outputs, including noise components and non-aggressively denoised BOLD series, as well as generate reports.\r\nTo join the discussion and contribute to this project, you can find more information in the related issue at [nipreps/fmriprep#2936](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues/2936).\n\n### Link to the Project\n\nhttps://github.com/nipreps/fmripost-aroma\n\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\n\n_No response_\n\n### Project lead\n\nC\u00e9line Provins, GitHub: @celprov , discord: cprovins\n\n### Main Hub\n\nMontreal\n\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\n\n- [ ] Montreal\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\n- [ ] Americas\n\n### Skills\n\nHaving basic Python knowledge is important, however all levels of experience are welcome.\n\n### Recommended tutorials for new contributors\n\n- [ ] [Set up a brainhack friendly computing environment](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/installation/)\n- [ ] [A introduction to Bash](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/introduction_to_terminal/)\n- [X] [Python: Writing a script](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_scripts/)\n- [ ] [Python: Data analysis with Python](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_data_analysis/)\n- [X] [Python: Visualisation](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_visualization/)\n- [ ] [Machine learning basics](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_basics/)\n- [X] [BIDS](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/bids/)\n- [ ] [Machine learning for neuroimaging](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_neuroimaging/)\n- [ ] [VCS: Using Git and Github](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/git_github/)\n- [ ] [VCS: Data management with Datalad](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/datalad/)\n- [ ] [Virtualization](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/containers/)\n- [ ] High Performance Computing: [Oracle cloud resource](https://brainhack.org/brainhack_cloud/)\n\n### Good first issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Twitter summary\n\n_No response_\n\n### Short name for the Discord chat channel (~15 chars)\n\nfmriprep_aroma\n\n### Please read and follow the OHBM Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow the OHBM Code of Conduct during the hackathon",

Using the powerful NiReports tooling, reportlets will be created from FreeSurfer runs to visualize and assess the quality of neuroimaging processing steps.\r\n\r\nThe project will leverage the NiReports assembler, which utilizes PyBIDS, to collect the reportlets generated by FreeSurfer. The assembler follows a report specification in YAML format, specifying the query for specific reportlets, their associated metadata, and text annotations. Ultimately, the assembler combines the reportlets into a single HTML file, providing an informative and concise summary of the FreeSurfer analysis.\r\n\r\nFreeSurfer is a widely used software package for structural and functional neuroimaging analysis, while NiReports, a part of the NiPreps' reporting and visualization tools, offers a powerful framework for organizing and presenting the results. This hackathon project aims to streamline the reporting process and enhance the visualization of FreeSurfer output, facilitating the interpretation and analysis of neuroimaging data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to the Project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nipreps/nireports\r\n\r\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Project lead\r\n\r\nMichael Dayan, GitHub: @neurorepro , discord: \r\n\r\n### Main Hub\r\n\r\nMontreal\r\n\r\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\r\n\r\n- [ ] Montreal\r\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\r\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\r\n- [ ] Americas\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\nTo make the most of this hackathon project, having some Python knowledge is important.

BIDS provides a simple and widely adopted framework for structuring neuroimaging and behavioral data, saving valuable time spent on data rearrangement or script modification.\r\nPython knowledge is recommended but optional to participate in this hackathon project.

However, many of these derivatives can be deterministically generated by a fairly small subset of \"first order\" derivatives, such as registration transforms.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to create a workflow that generates the minimal set of derivatives, as well as workflows for generating reports and other derivatives, such as resampled BOLD series and confound time series. The desired end result is a collection of modular workflows that can be composed either to produce the minimal set of derivatives or the full set that are the current outputs of fMRIPrep.\r\n\n\n### Link to the Project\n\nhttps://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/\n\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\n\n_No response_\n\n### Project lead\n\nChris Markiewicz, GitHub: @effigies, discord: Chris Markiewicz (gh: effigies)\n\n### Main Hub\n\nMontreal\n\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\n\n- [ ] Montreal\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\n- [ ] Americas\n\n### Skills\n\nWhile we encourage participants of all skill levels to join, a good understanding of Python is recommended to contribute to this project.\n\n### Recommended tutorials for new contributors\n\n- [X] [Set up a brainhack friendly computing environment](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/installation/)\n- [ ] [A introduction to Bash](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/introduction_to_terminal/)\n- [X] [Python: Writing a script](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_scripts/)\n- [ ] [Python: Data analysis with Python](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_data_analysis/)\n- [ ] [Python: Visualisation](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_visualization/)\n- [ ] [Machine learning basics](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_basics/)\n- [ ] [BIDS](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/bids/)\n- [ ] [Machine learning for neuroimaging](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_neuroimaging/)\n- [ ] [VCS: Using Git and Github](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/git_github/)\n- [ ] [VCS: Data management with Datalad](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/datalad/)\n- [ ] [Virtualization](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/containers/)\n- [ ] High Performance Computing: [Oracle cloud resource](https://brainhack.org/brainhack_cloud/)\n\n### Good first issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Twitter summary\n\n_No response_\n\n### Short name for the Discord chat channel (~15 chars)\n\nfmriprep_fit_apply\n\n### Please read and follow the OHBM Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow the OHBM Code of Conduct during the hackathon",

Physiopy is developing or has developed several physiology-oriented modular toolboxes to this end, including 1) _phys2bids_, a toolbox to standardize physiological files in BIDS format 2) _peakdet_, a toolbox for automatic detection and manual correction of  peaks in physiological data and 3) _phys2denoise_, a toolbox to prepare derivatives of physiological data for use in fMRI denoising. Currently, we have no complete workflows encompassing all steps of physiological data processing and model estimations. **The goal of this project is to facilitate a unified workflow across these toolboxes for semi-automated physiological signal processing.** \r\n\r\nDuring this hackathon, we aim to: \r\n\r\n- Create a semi-automated workflow based on peakdet and phys2denoise to process respiratory and cardiac signals and obtain models of physiological signal variance for neuroimaging analysis (e.g. RVT, HRV, ...)\r\n- Create a command line interface (CLI) for the workflows\r\n- Update and upgrade the current codebase of peakdet and phys2denoise, including better harmonization between toolboxes\r\n\r\nExtra and optional aims could include:\r\n- Create a graphical report of the workflows output\r\n- BIDS-App-lify the workflows: we want to create an entry point to transform the workflow into a [BIDS Application](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/)\r\n- Pydra-ify the libraries: to learn the strength of Pydra as a workflow manager, we can create a version of the workflow using Pydra.\r\n- Add support for eye-tracking and skin conductance data\r\n\r\nAll contributions are welcome and accepted, from any level of contribution. We follow the[ all-contributors specification](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) to report contributions, and adopt physiopy's [contributors guide](https://physiopy.github.io/community/contributor-guide/) and [code of conduct](https://physiopy.github.io/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT/).\n\n### Link to the Project\n\nhttps://github.com/physiopy/\n\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/physiopy/phys2bids/master/docs/_static/physiopy_logo_small.png\n\n### Project lead\n\nMary Miedema (Montreal), Github Username: m-miedema , Discord Username: m-miedema\r\nRoza Gunes Bayrak (Americas), Github Username: rgbayrak  Discord Username: @rgbayrak, \r\nMarie-Eve Picard (Montreal), Github Username: me-pic, Discord Username: Marie-Eve Picard (she/her)#4750 \r\n\n\n### Main Hub\n\nMontreal\n\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\n\n- [X] Montreal\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\n- [X] Americas\n\n### Skills\n\nWe welcome all contributors and contributions, from any skill set and level.

We manage a few physiology-oriented toolboxes to process physiological data, and we would like to add a new toolbox to help quality assurance of physiological data through (automatised) quality control. If you are familiar with MRIQC, or afni proc quality control - we want to do something similar, but for physiological data.\r\n\r\nDuring previous hackathons and meetings we planned the toolbox, and during these upcoming three days we'll implement a workflow to automatise it and get textual and image-based outputs, in order to get a starting point to report valuable QC information.\r\n\r\nAll contributions are welcome and accepted, from any level of contribution.

It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation and a friendly community. It includes applications such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), decoding, predictive modelling, functional connectivity, and brain parcellations. In recent years, we have developed functionality to support working with surfaces and we now have concrete plans for extending surface support in Nilearn in order to extend this functionality. To this end, we aim to get contributors to get familiar with the existing surface functionality and to work on issues to improve the surface module and surface plotting functions.\r\n\r\n## GOALS FOR THE BRAIN HACK\r\n\r\nContributors are encouraged to work on issues in the project board by opening pull requests. These include good first issues that will help first time contributors get started and also issues relating to surface functionality. Contributors are also welcome to open issues for relevant bugs or suggestions for enhancement of the current surface functionality. \r\n\r\n### Link to the Project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nilearn/nilearn\r\n\r\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\nhttps://nilearn.github.io/stable/_static/nilearn-transparent.png\r\n\r\n### Project lead\r\n\r\nHao-Ting Wang, Github: @htwangtw, Discord: haodareyou\r\nRemi Gau, Github: @Remi-Gau, Discord: remigau\r\nYasmin Mzayek, Github: @ymzayek, Discord: ymzayek\r\nElizabeth DuPre, Github: @emdupre, Discord: emdupre#8727\r\n\r\n### Main Hub\r\n\r\nMontreal\r\n\r\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\r\n\r\n- [ ] Montreal\r\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\r\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\r\n- [ ] Americas\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\nWe welcome all contributions from various skill sets and levels.

Before the end of the round table, two work groups should be established: one working on image quality metrics (IQMs), and the second working on visual QC\r\n- Next, we expect the two groups to work independently:\r\n    - The IQM group will select some metrics that feel relevant, and evaluate them.\r\n    - The visual QC group will set-up a few different visual QC proposal (i.e. views) for each pipeline they're studying, and attempt to evaluate their effectiveness\r\n\r\nWe expect the outcomes of this hackathon to be a set of IQM candidates and of graphical representation that could be included in the QC tools of Clinica\r\n\r\n### Link to the Project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aramis-lab/clinica\r\n\r\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\nhttps://www.clinica.run/assets/images/clinica-icon-257x257.png\r\n\r\n### Project lead\r\n\r\nName: Matthieu Joulot\r\nGitHub: MatthieuJoulot\r\nDiscord: Matthieu Joulot\r\n\r\n### Main Hub\r\n\r\nMontreal\r\n\r\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\r\n\r\n- [X] Montreal\r\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\r\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\r\n- [ ] Americas\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\nThe skills we are looking for are:\r\n\r\n- expertise in visual QC of neuro-imaging (structural MRI, diffusion MRI, PET) processing (segmentation, registration, ...)\r\n- expertise in the use of IQMs for quantitative QC of neuro-imaging (structural MRI, diffusion MRI, PET) processing (segmentation, registration, ...)\r\n\r\n### Recommended tutorials for new contributors\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Set up a brainhack friendly computing environment](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/installation/)\r\n- [ ] [A introduction to Bash](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/introduction_to_terminal/)\r\n- [ ] [Python: Writing a script](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_scripts/)\r\n- [ ] [Python: Data analysis with Python](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_data_analysis/)\r\n- [ ] [Python: Visualisation](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_visualization/)\r\n- [ ] [Machine learning basics](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_basics/)\r\n- [X] [BIDS](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/bids/)\r\n- [ ] [Machine learning for neuroimaging](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_neuroimaging/)\r\n- [ ] [VCS: Using Git and Github](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/git_github/)\r\n- [ ] [VCS: Data management with Datalad](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/datalad/)\r\n- [ ] [Virtualization](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/containers/)\r\n- [ ] High Performance Computing: [Oracle cloud resource](https://brainhack.org/brainhack_cloud/)\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Twitter summary\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Short name for the Discord chat channel (~15 chars)\r\n\r\nprocessing-qc\r\n\r\n### Please read and follow the OHBM Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the OHBM Code of Conduct during the hackathon",

Physiopy meetings feature discussions on what are suggested practices to set up and work with physiological data, that we are compiling to become available documentation for all interested users. This project specifically will work on continuing the compilation of such documentation, including a detailed overview of what physiological data are typically recorded during an fMRI experiment, how these signals are recorded, and how these signals can improve our modeling of fMRI time series data. We also hope to expand our package documentation containing tips and strategies on how to collect various forms of physiological data and the use of our packages. Imaging cerebral physiology as either signals of interest or denoising, is an active field of research, and we hope to encourage all users to get the latest recommendations prior to initiating a new study.\r\n\r\nThis project does not necessarily require coding skills to join.

Through the power of particle ~explosions~ animations, our project aims to shed light on the hidden wonders of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by explo~d~ring the intricacies of k-space and its relationship to the Fourier transform and brain images. Our ultimate goal is to create an enchanting video that unveils the magic of k-space sampling patterns and sparks curiosity among viewers.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to leverage particle animations to provide insights into the journey of traveling and sampling the k-space. By generating captivating visualizations, we aim to demystify the concept of k-space and the role it plays in MRI, engaging both the scientific community and the general public in a delightful exploration of this fundamental aspect of imaging.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n- _Particle Animation Wizardry:_ We will create an array of animated particles that represent the journey within the k-space. These particles will travel, interact, and dynamically respond to the sampling process, offering a visually captivating representation of the Fourier transform in action.\r\n- _K-Space ~Explosion~ Sampling Patterns:_ Through manipulation of the animated particles, we will generate various k-space sampling patterns that demonstrate the importance of sampling strategies in MRI. By altering particle behavior, density, and distribution, we will illustrate the impact of different sampling schemes on image quality and resolution.\r\n- _Video Compilation:_ The generated particle animations and k-space sampling patterns will be compiled into a visually stunning and informative video. This video will showcase the beauty and complexity of the k-space journey, making it accessible to a wide audience. To reach a broad community of researchers and enthusiasts, we will publish the final video on YouTube. This platform will enable us to share the captivating visuals, educate viewers about k-space and the Fourier transform, and spark curiosity and discussions around the fascinating world of MRI.\r\n\r\n### Link to the Project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ofgulban/k_particles\r\n\r\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1r2lLUgqEoLL2gsW9ejSGrOvD6aOli3y0/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n### Project lead\r\n\r\nOmer Faruk Gulban, Github: @ofgulban , Discord: ofgulban\r\n\r\n### Main Hub\r\n\r\nMontreal\r\n\r\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\r\n\r\n- [X] Montreal\r\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\r\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\r\n- [ ] Americas\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- ffmpeg\r\n\r\n### Recommended tutorials for new contributors\r\n\r\n- [X] [Set up a brainhack friendly computing environment](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/installation/)\r\n- [ ] [A introduction to Bash](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/introduction_to_terminal/)\r\n- [X] [Python: Writing a script](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_scripts/)\r\n- [X] [Python: Data analysis with Python](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_data_analysis/)\r\n- [X] [Python: Visualisation](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_visualization/)\r\n- [ ] [Machine learning basics](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_basics/)\r\n- [ ] [BIDS](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/bids/)\r\n- [ ] [Machine learning for neuroimaging](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_neuroimaging/)\r\n- [ ] [VCS: Using Git and Github](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/git_github/)\r\n- [ ] [VCS: Data management with Datalad](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/datalad/)\r\n- [ ] [Virtualization](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/containers/)\r\n- [ ] High Performance Computing: [Oracle cloud resource](https://brainhack.org/brainhack_cloud/)\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n- Generate animations using the example scripts\r\n\r\n### Twitter summary\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Short name for the Discord chat channel (~15 chars)\r\n\r\nk-particles\r\n\r\n### Please read and follow the OHBM Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the OHBM Code of Conduct during the hackathon",

As a part of that, we have automated the nested cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization loop. However, the optimal approach for choosing the most suitable hyperparameter configuration continues to be an open problem. For example, the hyperparameter configuration that performs best on the validation set might be overly specific to the particularities of the validation set and thus underperform in new applications. \r\n\r\n## GOALS FOR THE BRAIN HACK\r\n\r\n- brainstorm strategies on how to select the best hyperparameter configuration to maximize generalization performance\r\n- implement ensembling techniques, i.e. select several hyperparameter configurations \r\n\n\n### Link to the Project\n\ngithub.com/wwu-mmll/photonai\n\n### Image for the OHBM brainhack website\n\n_No response_\n\n### Project lead\n\nJan Ernsting, Github: jernsting, Discord: Jan#5471\r\nRamona Leenings, Github: rleenings, Discord: ramona_photonai\n\n### Main Hub\n\nMontreal\n\n### Other Hub covered by the leaders\n\n- [ ] Montreal\n- [ ] Asia / Pacific\n- [ ] Europe / Middle East / Africa\n- [ ] Americas\n\n### Skills\n\nBasic Python\r\nBasic Machine Learning or Statistic Knowledge\n\n### Recommended tutorials for new contributors\n\n- [X] [Set up a brainhack friendly computing environment](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/installation/)\n- [ ] [A introduction to Bash](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/introduction_to_terminal/)\n- [X] [Python: Writing a script](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_scripts/)\n- [X] [Python: Data analysis with Python](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_data_analysis/)\n- [ ] [Python: Visualisation](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/python_visualization/)\n- [X] [Machine learning basics](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_basics/)\n- [ ] [BIDS](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/bids/)\n- [ ] [Machine learning for neuroimaging](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/machine_learning_neuroimaging/)\n- [X] [VCS: Using Git and Github](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/git_github/)\n- [ ] [VCS: Data management with Datalad](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/datalad/)\n- [ ] [Virtualization](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/containers/)\n- [ ] High Performance Computing: [Oracle cloud resource](https://brainhack.org/brainhack_cloud/)\n\n### Good first issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Twitter summary\n\n_No response_\n\n### Short name for the Discord chat channel (~15 chars)\n\nphotonai\n\n### Please read and follow the OHBM Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow the OHBM Code of Conduct during the hackathon",

Among others, this prominently refers to data obtained through and during connectivity analyses. This comprises brain parcellations, connectivity maps, structural and functional connections, major white matter tracts, diffusion signal models, white matter tractograms and tractometry, as well as networks based on dimensionality reduction. Sharing processed data and features in addition to raw and minimally-processed data is critical to accelerating scientific discovery. This is because substantial effort, software, and hardware instrumentation, and know-how are required to bring raw data to a usable state. The aim of the present project is to extend the BIDS standard to encompass derivatives resulting from experiments related to macroscopic brain connectivity (U.S. National Institutes of Health NIMH R01-MH126699). During the Brainhack, we would like to \r\n\r\n1. Gather feedback from experts, users, tool developers, ie everyone!\r\n2.

The FSuB-Extractor is a tool that enables users to extract and analyze white matter bundles based on their intersection with gray matter functional ROIs. This approach has been used to study **f**unctional **su**b-components of **b**undles (FSuB) that support certain cognitive and perceptive tasks [(e.g., Kubota et al., 2022, _Cerebral Cortex_)](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-abstract/33/6/2485/6603928).\r\n\r\nRight now we have a functioning workflow, but we would like to formalize it more by migrating our workflow to something like Pydra or Nipype, and set up a software container and continuous integration workflow. We would also like to have outputs that follow BIDS as much as they can (keeping in mind the BIDS derivatives conventions -including connectivity derivatives- are still being codified). Even if you are unexperienced with contributing to code bases, we would still greatly appreciate feedback from beta testers!\r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you are interested or have questions!\r\n\r\n### Short name for the Discord chat channel (~15 chars)\r\n\r\nfsub-extractor\r\n\r\n### Please read and follow the OHBM Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the OHBM Code of Conduct during the hackathon",
