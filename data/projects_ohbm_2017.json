In the field of functional neuroimaging, we often refer to changes in brain activity when what we\u2019re actually measuring are changes in the magnetic properties of blood flowing through the brain. While there is certainly value in the use of this particular proxy, it is important not to lose sight of the source of the signal. The discovery of how blood circulates throughout the body was perhaps the most significant medical breakthrough of the seventeenth century. Blood is what gives us life by connecting our hearts and our brains and is a common denominator for all humanity.\r\n\r\nThe artwork entitled \"**_Deep Blood_**\" is the result of a collaborative science and art project that took place during the OHBM Hackathon. It was created using the Deep Style algorithm, a more advanced version of the original Deep Dream approach that uses its own knowledge to interpret an image\u2019s style and transfer it to another image. Initially Deep Dream was invented to help scientists and engineers to see what a deep neural network is seeing when it is looking in a given image, but it has recently been adopted as a method for generating psychedelic and abstract art. \r\n\r\n_**Deep Blood**_ presents an artistic interpretation of brain vasculature by displaying macro-level susceptibility-weighted imaging in the style of micro-level immunohistochemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

BASC also creates group level functional parcellations, and by bootstrapping across the individual-wise stability maps, allows you to assess how representative your group level maps are of the individuals in your cohort. Importantly, this method is wholly data derived and does not place group level constraints to extract the individual level parcels.\r\n* **TODO**: At BrainHack we are working on two features: (1) Outputting individual level parcellations for individual-level graph theoretical analysis in PyNets.

Turns out fMRI is hard! Neuroscout aims to provide a rapid and flexible platform for fMRI analysis, allowing researchers to go from hypothesis to shareable results in a matter of hours, not months. \r\n\r\nSpecific goals which are in progress:\r\n \r\n* A flexible BIDS-y nipype workflow that can be fully specified without editing the workflow via JSON configuration files\r\n* Command line interface to download data and software requirements and execute the workflows in the cloud or on local machines (thanks to DataLad and NeuroDebian!)\r\n* Web front-end for Neuroscout. \r\n",

        "body": "John Griffiths et Friends\r\n\r\nDynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) is a framework for modelling (primarily) neuroimaging data signals using biophysically-based neural population models, with an emphasis on (small) networks and estimation of effective connectivity. DCM lives inside SPM, somewhat confusingly spread across multiple sub-toolboxes, and following the standard SPM convention of being cryptically coded and poorly (if at all) documented. This project aims to liberate DCM from these squalid matlab shackles, \r\nand (to mix metaphors somewhat) unleash unto it the beast that is the mne-python and broader nipy development community. A subsidiary aim is to make some of the better parts of the DCM optimization machinery available to the neurophysiological modelling and neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain (TVB).\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s really two components to DCM \u2013 the neural modelling part, which (for M/EEG) are generally variants on the second-order linear filter-type model of Jansen & Rit, and the model estimation part, which use Variational Bayes E-M type algorithms. For this project we\u2019ll focus on the neural models described in spm_dcm_erp.m, and the generic VB-inversion routine spm_nlsi_N.m, plus the related helper functions above and below these two. We will push hard, and aim to have a functioning MNE-Python ERP-DCM implementation by the end of the hackathon. The acid test shall be to be able to run the DCM ERP tutorial in the SPM manual.\r\n\r\nThere should be many interesting questions that come up along the way, to do with improvements and general integration with other nipy and generic python libraries. Can we make use of other python libraries such as scikit-learn for parts of this? Would the VB-inversion routine be useful for fitting non-DCM models in MNE? Etc. etc. I\u2019m hoping to get lots of feedback and good ideas from the imaging community on these Qs.\r\n\r\nSlacking on #mne-dcm\r\n",

However, manual invervention is necessary to QC results or when certain stages of the pipeline fail, especially when analyzing pathological brains. When analyzing large datasets this process may become error prone. To help organize inspection and editing of FreeSurfer output among collaborators,  [Mindcontrol](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.03.055) was developed as an open source web-based tool for quality control of neuroimaging pipeline outputs.\r\n\r\nDuring this brainhack, we aim to extend Mindcontrol in the following ways:\r\n- Create a Docker container encapsulating all of the components of Mindcontrol, to make it easier to deploy.\r\n- Continue development of Nipype workflows to automatically prepare FreeSurfer output to be viewed within Mindcontrol.\r\n- Create workflows to re-run various FreeSurfer processing steps after manual inteventions have been made in Mindcontrol\r\n- Extend [documentation](https://github.com/akeshavan/mindcontrol_docs) to make it easier for other users to set up Mindcontrol for their own data\r\n",

The [pybids](https://github.com/INCF/pybids) library contains various tools for manipulating BIDS projects. In this project, we'll continue ongoing work to implement the draft transformations spec in pybids so as to enable fully automated application of complex transformations encoded in a compact JSON spec. This will allow researchers to create much more sophisticated design matrices by manipulating behavioral data and/or event files without having to write any new code.",

Given the idea that future publications should include the following supplementary information: 1) the raw data; 2) the analysis workflow; 3) the operating system description; and 4) a complete set of results; we seek to improve our example. We expect to: expand the query and data representation (multiple data sources, NIDM-E markup); execute a more complex workflow that includes a between group statistical test (so that test-statistics can be an outcome for evaluation); utilize a workflow that  runs two (or more) different tools that are nominally supposed to generate the same outcome metric, etc. All of this will be undertaken with an eye to simplifying the approach of how to do this for the typical neuroimaigng researcher end-user.",

Halchenko and everyone else welcome to join\r\n\r\nIt is quite often desired to provide standard output from a script in a consistent (e.g. tabular) layout whenever not all entries are known ahead of time and some entries might either have values changing or affecting previous lines.  E.g. it could be that underlying process either async providing values back for display later in time or just that values for already presented entries pulled again from time to time (e.g. status of a job).  Or a simple use-case -- values for later output lines should adjust presentation of previous lines (e.g. a column should be expanded in the tabular view).  The idea is to use basic ANSI lines navigation/editing commands to adjust previously presented output.  It should be similar in vein to how e.g. \"docker pull\", multiple tqdm progress bar are managed on the screen (e.g. try doing `datalad install -g -J4 ///labs/haxby/raiders/` to see example, or how \"tig\" updates author field in the tree view.  This module could then be used as a helper for various Python projects demanding \"reactive\" standard output.\r\nIt might as well be that such module already exists, so if you know some -- please share pointers.",

It contains 122 subjects of 64 channel EEG data in a delayed matched to sample task from Henri Beglieter's Neurodynamics Lab. Since the data has already been epoched, we will focus on the comparison the standard comparison of alternative DCM models and the use of DCM parameter estimates as inputs to machine learning for group classification. Since no MRI is available for the subjects, we will use a standard space BEM head model (default in SPM). The resulting DCM modeling will be used in the near future for a Paris Saclay Center for Data Science ramp comparison with non-DCM-based classification methods.\r\n",

To do this, we aim to develop an atlas of these structures based on high resolution, high quality anatomical MRI and test it on publicly available data sets.\r\n\r\nThe first couple steps will be making substructure definitions on high resolution images and tractography on high res DWI. If you are interested in brainstem anatomy, the auditory system, tractography, or like/have access to high res imaging (especially post mortem!), let's work together!\r\n",

Schizophrenia affects different regions of the brain which subsequently causes hallucination and delusion. Localization of affected regions in schizophrenia may help us understand the condition and effect of disorder better and may also assist in deciding the line of treatment. This project will throw some light on the region-wise analysis and their individual working condition in the brain having schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nObjective of the Project: \r\n1) ROI study of affected brain in schizophrenia using fMRI data to investigate the functional changes in each region.\r\n2) Identification of the most affected region(s) in Schizophrenia\r\n3) To develop a decision model using Multi-objective optimisation evolutionary approach.\r\n\r\nWe will be using some pre-defined atlases on FBIRN Phase II Data repository. With due acknowledgment, I have attached the PreProcessed(Direct Normalisation upto smoothing) Auditory Oddball task dataset for 4 runs of 1.5T fMRI dataset of 34 schizophrenic and 34 healthy subjects. Also attached the Contrast Maps for each run of the data after applying GLM approach.\r\nRepository with data and atlas can be found here: https://github.com/IndraChatterjee/fMRI-ROI-analysis-of-Schizophrenia \r\n",

Halchenko & Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello\r\n\r\nWe've been recently working on [heudiconv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv) to adapt it for our needs at the Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center. Heudiconv converts DICOMs into NIFTIs using configurable heuristics, and we adopted it to automatically convert the DICOMs from our scanner into BIDS format, in order to facilitate the use of BIDS apps and later sharing of datasets both within and outside our department. The main goal of this project would be to exploit the presence of the main developers at the hackathon (Satra Ghosh, Michael Hanke, Yarik, et al.) to introduce clean changes to the master branch that can be used by other sites, for example the monitoring tool we created to automatically convert DICOMs, or the numerous customizations (...breaking the API...) we added (see https://github.com/dartmouth-pbs/heudiconv/tree/enh-dbic2)",

The goal is to automatically read the relevant features from the processed output of popular tools, including but not limited to, OPPNI, FSL, DTIstudio, Freesurfer, MRtrix and various BIDS apps and present a comprehensive predictive analysis report (see [here](https://github.com/raamana/neuropredict/blob/master/docs/composite_flyer.001.png)) on a given dataset, in a plug and play fashion. The focus of neuropredict is to standardize and automate the predictive analysis to let the user to focus on building new and interesting features, and compare them. Hence we aim to support a wide variety of input formats for features (arbitrary user input by via CSVs and other popular ML formats). It is mainly aimed at users interested in identifying discriminative features, predictive brain regions, evaluating their predictive accuracy and performing statistical model comparison (each of which are non-trivial). The target user has datasets and hypotheses but lacks the necessary machine learning, programming and the technical skills needed to produce such a report. However, it is also beneficial to advanced users also whose focus is not on predictive modeling, but would like to complete their analysis by adding a predictive component to their standard analysis.\r\n\r\n**Note**: There is no redundancy in the functionality and large audience of neuropredict with other similar packages, such as nilearn, pymvpa, PRoNTo and PyML etc. It serves a very different purpose and a different audience compared to the older software, which are albeit powerful and general, almost all of them require programming as well as domain expertise to learn and utilize them. The user may indeed use them to produce useful features, whose predictive power could be assessed effortlessly with [neuropredict](https://github.com/raamana/neuropredict).\r\n\r\nJoin the [neuropredict BrainHack channel](https://brainhack.slack.com/messages/C4CT1UE1Y) to follow and contribute to the development.\r\n",
