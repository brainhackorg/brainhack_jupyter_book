Today, progress is limited by centralised systems built on outdated infrastructure. This restricts global access to study participation, research funding, scientific collaboration and knowledge creation. Participants also do not retain ownership or control over their own data. Our solution is a decentralised open science stack leveraging blockchain technologies. Global citizens are empowered to take part in studies whilst retaining full ownership and control over their data, and scientists are incentivised to share data and collaborate with their peers. Our solution empowers both citizens and scientists to become the new shareholders of scientific progress.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/opscientia/desci\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n\r\nSarah: sarahh\r\nShady: seldamat\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n\r\nGoal 1:\r\n- Gather feedback from the Neuroscience community on Opscientia's vision and solution\r\n- Use this feedback to inform our overall strategy and roadmap\r\n\r\nGoal 2:\r\n- Gather specific user feedback on our Decentralised Science Stack wireframe (Open Science Bay)\r\n- From this generate user personas and requirements for our stack and refine UX\r\n\r\nGoal 3:\r\n- Kick off our community of Neuroscientists! \r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n\r\n- Create a protocol for 1:1 user research interviews with Neuroscientists from the HBM community\r\n- Complete 5 user research interviews \r\n- Create an online questionnaire to gather feedback from the wider Neuroscience community\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n\r\nUser research, user experience, questionnaire design, community building\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhbm-opscientia\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nAs we are not finalised the platform for the hackathon yet, for now there is no need to fill the section for video channel..\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84068191/122251425-66497700-cec2-11eb-9c4a-29138a781f00.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Twitter-size summary**\r\n\r\nCatalysing the pace of scientific discovery with a decentralised open science stack that democratises and modernises research pipelines, and empowers citizens and scientists to become the new shareholders of scientific progress.\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2021/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

Data provenance and versioning is done using datalad with a special remote for IPFS.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/opscientia/web3weekend-hackathon\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handles**:\r\nShady - seldamat\r\nKinshuk - kashyap_kinshuk\r\nAchintya - achintya\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- Demonstrate uploading a BIDS-validated dataset to p2p storage through the datawallet. Currently this is buggy - the upload works but metadata doesn't get stored, so fetching the file list gives empty values.\r\n- (stretch goal) Debug [git-annex-remote-ipfs](https://github.com/opscientia/brainhack2020_DeSci) script, test integration with datalad. The issue with the bash script is most likely in the RETRIEVE procedure, as the files succesfully get uploaded to IPFS\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Creating different fields for metadata before uploading to Database - https://github.com/opscientia/web3weekend-hackathon/issues/20\r\n- Add a welcome tile/popup with description about each tab when opened - https://github.com/opscientia/web3weekend-hackathon/issues/20\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- Javascript\r\n- BIDS\r\n- Git and Github\r\n- UI/UX\r\n- datalad\r\n- BASH scripting\r\n- Interest in opening up science for everyone!\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-opscientia\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5251243/122254563-d8ce4d00-ceea-11eb-840c-198ca7794642.png)\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2021/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

A workflow is represented as a graph, and each node is a Task object, which may be a Python function or an interface to an external tool.\r\n\r\nDuring this hackathon we want to work on the core package, but also prepare converters for Nipype 1.0 interfaces. We are also planning to improve documentation and tutorials.  \r\n\r\nPyrda is a lightweight, Py3.7+ dataflow engine for computational graph construction, manipulation, and distributed execution. \r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nany repo from the nipype organization: https://github.com/nipype\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\ndorota, markiewicz, haoting, jeffrey\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- working on pydra - dataflow engine\r\n- converting Nipype interfaces\r\n- adding better support for boutiques\r\n- improving documentation and tutorial\r\nfull list could be found (and edited) here: \r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZuMD-hagnUQPZvud8k1jXdAPE55RpWGMYXcVBcsw6S8/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- exploring tutorial: https://github.com/nipype/pydra-tutorial\r\n- improving documentation: https://github.com/nipype/pydra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\r\n\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- some python \r\n- nipype experience (optional)\r\n- experience with any software supported by nipype (FSL, ANTs, SPM, etc.; optional) \r\n- distributed execution (optional)\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n- nipype\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/nipype\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nwe will be using either the main platform or jitsi.

Our goal is to assess the 'impact' of the [cleanBib](https://github.com/dalejn/cleanBib) tool, which was created to make researchers more aware of this problem. This tool can be used to assess the gender balance of authors in a reference list. Specifically, we want to find papers that cite the cleanBib [code](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3672109)/[paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y)/[preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.03.894378), and see whether those citing papers have better gender balance in their reference lists than papers that do not. \r\n\r\nIn previous hackathons, we created this figure by manually collecting citation diversity data from papers with citation diversity statements. It shows the relative gender proportions in reference lists of papers with diversity statements (relative to the expected gender proportions).\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/master/reports/figures/relative_diversity__with_swarm__with_title.png)\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n[GitHub repo](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact)\r\n[Running agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BqmiSoTpdzCXc9rTHQ4LyNhTBMVRASDZTboKzBsM2ww/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\nkendra.oudyk\r\nisil\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- [ ] [1.

We use containerization technology to run ERP analysis Python scripts as modular units with I/O to the FLOW database, thus facilitating reproducibility across different stages of analysis. The containerization approach allows easy integration of existing analysis scripts, thus making FLOW an environment that can be adjusted to lab needs.\r\n\r\nBEL aims to provide the community with the means to write their own EEG analysis workflows and share them with others. We are working to create an environment where researchers can pilot workflows in a live Jupyter Notebooks integration of FLOW, then convert these to streamlined FLOW workflows which can be shared with the community. Our project will help guide participants through creating, packaging, and containerizing analysis scripts using open source Python analysis tools and Docker. We will then demonstrate how these workflows can be integrated in FLOW for data management, analysis, and visualization through our [Sourcerer](https://bel.company/products/sourcerer) software. We will do this via a live instance of FLOW that will be up throughout the course of the hackathon. We invite interested parties to try out FLOW for themselves in order to see what this software has to offer.\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/BEL-Public/eeg-workflows\r\n* [Our live FLOW instance](https://flow-brainhack2021.bel.company/login) (Contact project leads to create an account)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @ephathaway, @ianbrown9475\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n\r\n* Integrate an EEG analysis workflow from an outside collaborator into FLOW\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/BEL-Public/eeg-workflows/issues/4#: Take a look at our [contribute section](https://github.com/BEL-Public/eeg-workflows#contribute) to learn how to add your own EEG analysis workflow to FLOW\r\n* https://github.com/BEL-Public/eeg-workflows/issues/5#: Improve the EEG artifact detection module by implementing detection of specific artifact types\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n\r\n* EEG/ERP analysis\r\n* Python (beginner)\r\n* Jupyter Notebooks\r\n* Docker (helpful, but not required)\r\n* Git - 2\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:  https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brain-electrophysiology-laboratory---flow\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nAs we are not finalised the platform for the hackathon yet, for now there is no need to fill the section for video channel..\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"253\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-14 at 3 41 23 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42755980/121968434-2e59fc80-cd27-11eb-83a2-2fb0e67bb83b.png\">\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2021/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

This brainhack project acts as user testing for the software by applying its workflow to a large-scale dataset. The Courtois Neuromod project is a longitudinal program which collects massive amounts of multimodal data (neuroimaging, peripheral physiologicals signal and eye-tracking) with the same 6 subjects throughout different tasks.

Historically, collective action problems like this have been solved with collective action, i.e. the mass uptake of new behaviours that aim to further the group's interests. More recently, online conditional pledge platforms (e.g., Kickstarter) have demonstrated that collective action can be organised on a global scale with zero risk to users, serving to cut out middle-men and directly benefit the users themselves. At present, however, this strategy has yet to take hold in academia.\r\n\r\nProject Free Our Knowledge (FOK) aims to rectify this by organising collective action in the research community. Using our platform, researchers can pledge to support open science practices, subject to there being a critical mass of support for the proposed behaviour. If the threshold is achieved, everyone who has pledged is contacted and directed to carry out the action together, thus motivating cultural change with minimal risk to individuals. \r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n[Website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/)\r\n[Github](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/)\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectFOK)\r\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n@cooper_smout\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n1. Open up a group discussion to determine everyone's interests\r\n2. Figure out some focus-groups that are interested in similar objectives\r\n3. Move into breakout rooms and develop the campaign ideas \r\n4. Propose new campaigns by clicking ['New Issue' in Github](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adraft-campaign) and filling in the template\r\n5. Return to the group and pitch our proposals\r\n6. Comment on each others' proposals using the comments thread in Github\r\n7. If we're happy with any particular proposals, we can also post them to the [FOK website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org) to start collecting signatures immediately.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n1. Read the project [README](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/edit/master/README.md) to understand the project background, structure, and ways you can support/follow us\r\n2. Read through the [campaign proposals that have already been proposed](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adraft-campaign) and comment/react to any campaigns that you're interested in\r\n3. If you have an idea for a campaign that hasn't yet been proposed, start thinking about what action you would like people to adopt and how many people you think should do it together. Then we can discuss this when we meet in the hackathon.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\nNo skills required, just a healthy desire for change (but would help if people can sign up to Github beforehand)\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n- [hbmhack-fok](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-fok)\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nAs we are not finalised the platform for the hackathon yet, for now there is no need to fill the section for video channel..\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2021/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

One of the current development goals is to make phys2bids smarter by implementing an automatic signal classificator. Ideally, given a physiological signal as input, phys2bids should be able to determine the type of the signal (cardiac, respiratory \u2026). \r\n\r\nTo move forward, this project is structured as a challenge: we provide time-series data of 4 kinds of physiological signals (cardiac, respiratory chest, O2 and CO2) and the goal will be to collaborate to find robust features that allow discerning between them.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n- [phys2bids](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids)\r\n- [Related issue](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids/issues/404)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n- [@drombas](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/messages/@drombas)\r\n- [@smoia](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/messages/@smoia) \r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n1. Find a set of features that allow us to classify the 4 signals in our dataset with 100% accuracy\r\n2. (If time permits) Extend the algorithm to classify other signals (e.g. galvanic skin response)\r\n3. (If time permits) Test the algorithm in other datasets\r\n\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Create a google collab file for basic data loading and visualization\r\n- Create a shared google document to share ideas/results\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- Basic knowledge of time-series analysis and programming is desirable but not required \r\n- Creativity to come up with ideas\r\n\r\n**Number of participants:** <= 10\r\n\r\n**Acknowledge contributions:** Physiopy adopts the [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) system to recognise contributions.

BIDScoin is also a python3 toolkit that is meant to format MRI source files in BIDS. BIDScoin comes with data discovery functionality and a graphical interface to customize the formatting heuristics. The actual interaction with the source data is done using plugins and the BIDScoin framework itself is therefore agnostic about the source data modality. Currently, phys2bids lacks data discovery functionality and BIDScoin lacks a formatting backend for physiological data. The goal of this brainhack project is to develop the plugin interface between BIDScoin and phys2bids and hence combine their complementary functionality for both projects\r\n\r\n**Link to project**\r\n- [Initial post](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids/issues/199)\r\n- [phys2bids](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids)\r\n- [BIDScoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin)\r\n- [Brainhack pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13IY2NolS9PRQe0ktw5Jzy2D1gEzqwbcTePJ45l9Vqjw/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**\r\n- [@smoia](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/messages/@smoia)\r\n- [@mpzwiers](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/messages/@mpzwiers)\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n1. Move part of the main phys2bids workflow to a phys2bids.info function:\r\n    a. to test if a source file is supported\r\n    b. to retrieve attributes from source files\r\n2. Add YAML support for heuristics in phys2bids\r\n3. Write a BIDScoin \u201cbidsmapper\u201d data discovery plugin function using (1) and (2)\r\n4. Write a BIDScoin \u201cbidscoiner\u201d data formatting plugin / wrapper around phys2bids\r\n5. Create a phys2bids bidsmap section with sensible (regexp) heuristics\r\n6. Extra goal: Add YAML support for system call configuration in phys2bids\r\n7. Extra goal: Expand the attribute dictionary retrieved by phys2bids\r\n8. Extra goal: Write a plugin test function\r\n9. Extra goal: Move SIEMENS physiological files conversion to phys2bids\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**\r\n1. User testing (toward the end of the hackathon), e.g. by creating a test / example data-set\r\n2. Documentation (toward the end of the hackathon), both for phys2bids and for BIDScoin\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n- Mandatory for good first issue: none\r\n- Plus for good first issue: little experience with bidsification and/or physiological recordings, or little experience with restructuredtext and readthedocs\r\n- Mandatory for other part of the project: git, python\r\n\r\n**Number of participants**\r\n5-15\r\n\r\n**Acknowledge contributions**\r\nPhysiopy adopts the [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) system to recognise contributions. Contributors will be recognised as such in the relevant library README (e.g. [here](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids#contributors-)) and as authors during outreach (conference posters, talks, ...). \r\n\r\n**Documentation** \r\n- [physiopy's contributors guidelines](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributorfile.html)\r\n- [physiopy's code of conduct](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conduct.html)\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**\r\n[~hbm-physiopy](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/physiopy)\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n![phys2bidscoin_logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15156015/121773540-e4351780-cb7c-11eb-9ce0-de9b6fb0ba75.png)\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2021/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).

Our initiative to create an Agreed Reporting Template for an International Standard includes a draft template designed to make reporting EEG methodology easier and more accurate, by providing fields for researchers to input specific methodological details (ARTEM-IS https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PDX6Y). Read more about why we need this tool and how you can help to make it better in our preprint: ([https://psyarxiv.com/myn7t](https://psyarxiv.com/myn7t)).

I will be mainly using a few [LayNii](https://github.com/layerfMRI/LAYNII) programs that I have been developing for high resolution imaging over the last year (e.g. [layers](https://thingsonthings.org/ln2_layers/), [columns](https://thingsonthings.org/ln2_columns/)) to generate mesmerizing brain animations. I will focus on using animal brains from one of my favorite projects: <https://braincatalogue.org/>. I already have a few exotic brains segmented and animated using triangular meshes:\r\n- [Dophin brain](https://twitter.com/ofgulban/status/1334186959581958144?s=20) :dolphin: \r\n- [Giraffe brain](https://twitter.com/ofgulban/status/1344316904991825922?s=20) :giraffe: \r\n- [Okapi brain](https://twitter.com/ofgulban/status/1345448996651806720?s=20) :zebra: :giraffe: \r\n- [Rhinoceros brain](https://twitter.com/ofgulban/status/1343274323893739520?s=20) :rhinoceros: \r\n\r\nHowever, in this project, the focus will be on generating 3D volumetric renders directly using nifti images, rather than using triangular meshes. For this, I will be using the excellent [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/).\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n<https://github.com/ofgulban/flooding_brains>\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\nofgulban, hbmhack-flooding_brains\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**:\r\n- Flood animal brains.\r\n- Flood human brains\r\n- More brains?\r\n- Create different compositions/shots/scenes.\r\n- [Stretch goal] Add sound effects.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Install the dependencies and try following the guide section [here](https://github.com/ofgulban/flooding_brains#guide).\r\n- Create flooding animations with your own data. I will work on making this process smoother during the event.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- Python\r\n- C++ (not crucial)\r\n- ffmpeg (not crucial)\r\n- I am looking for someone who has some sound processing skills.

The fact that scanners usually contain private information about patients and are thus embedded in maximally restrictive clinical cyber-security environments, makes it quite complicated to get access to the data. Especially when visiting collaborative sites.\r\n\r\nIn this Hackathon project, we aim to develop a purely uni-directional (safe) data streaming \u201chack\u201d to transfer MRI data directly to the cloud by means dynamic QR codes.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Internet, modems (**mod**ulator-**dem**odulator) were used to (i) convert digital information into audio streams, (ii) transfer them across telephone lines, and (iii) convert them back into the digital domain. Here, we aim to do the same thing with pixel data of MRI scans. However, instead of audio signal we will use machine-readable visual information: QR codes. \r\n\r\n**Specific aims of the Brain QR modem**\r\n\r\n1. We will develop an ICE-Functor that converts pixel data to QR codes in real time\r\n2. We will develop an Android app that converts the streamed QR coded into a series of png that are directly streamed to the cloud (Drive folder).\r\n3.

Installing and maintaining a neuroimaging software setup is challenging and often results in un-reproducible environments. Package managers and software repositories can help with this and NeuroDebian is a well-known example that drastically improves the neuroscience software distribution. However, a limitation of NeuorDebian is the inability to install neuroscientific software on Linux flavours commonly used on high performance computing systems or Windows and Macintosh computers. Researchers therefore still struggle to get access to the required software or to move analyses between different computing platforms due to the setup work required - ultimately limiting interoperability and reproducibility and impeding the broad sharing of analysis pipelines with the community. Container technology, such as docker or singularity, enables the execution of software on different operating systems and could aid in distributing scientific software. We are developing NeuroDesk, a platform build on container technology for processing and analysing neuroimaging data with the aim to lower the barrier of using various neuroimaging software in a reproducible environment, so that researchers spend less time on setting up and maintaining an analysis environment.\r\n\r\nTwo minute video introducing the project: https://youtu.be/JLv_5fycugw\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/NeuroDesk\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @sbollmann_mri\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**:\r\n- develop an electron user interface for Mac/Linux/Win that manages the docker setup in the background and provides a VNC/RDP client with clipboard support\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- run NeuroDesk on your system and let us know what problems you run into and where usability could be improved\r\n- Open an issue for tools that you would like to see in NeuroDesk: https://github.com/NeuroDesk/caid/issues\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- ideas for improving usability for non-technical users\r\n- electron/node.js/webassembly\r\n- github actions\r\n- linux admin skills\r\n- docker/singularity containers\r\n- building neurodocker recipes\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/virtual-neuro-machine-vnm\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nAs we are not finalised the platform for the hackathon yet, for now there is no need to fill the section for video channel..\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n![PXQHthA-_400x400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4021595/119743595-9312fb80-becd-11eb-9718-68239c08d085.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2021/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).
