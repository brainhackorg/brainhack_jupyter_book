        "body": "Submitted by Athina Tzovara*\r\n\r\nThe goal of this [project](https://github.com/aath0/MEEGTools) is to create online resources for helping students or researchers transition towards the use of open and reproducible techniques for analyzing M/i/EEG data. As the culture around open* is gaining momentum, an increasing number of researchers in the field of electro- / magneto-encephalography are transitioning from close- to open-source techniques. However, this transition can be challenging, especially if it is not explicitly encouraged in one\u2019s lab or institute culture, and because very often, online resources are sparse and have been originally developed for other fields. \r\nDuring the Brainhack we can use openly shared datasets and start by exploring and comparing existing toolboxes for analysing M/EEG data in python or R, identify strengths and weakness for each of them for different types of analyses. While working on these analyses we can prepare Python or R jupyter notebooks that can be eventually assembled as a tutorial for analyzing M/i/EEG data. \r\nUltimately, we could work towards proposing this as an additional workshop  for the data carpentry , which provides workshop materials  for computational research in various domains, such as bioinformatics or social science, but so far have no materials for neuroscience.\r\n\r\nFind out what we're working on on the project's [repo](https://github.com/aath0/MEEGTools)!\r\n",

It currently includes tools for querying BIDS datasets, extracting variables, specifying fMRI analysis models (via BIDS-Model), auto-generating partial methods sections, and more. There are lots of [opportunities to contribute](https://github.com/INCF/pybids/issues), including a number of issues that are suitable for beginners (writing documentation, creating better examples, etc.). If you want to help BIDSify the neuroimaging world, come hack with us!\r\n",

        "body": "Submitted by Ying-Qiu Zheng*\r\n\r\n#### Motivation:\r\n\r\nNetwork models have become one of the most popular areas in neuroscience in recent decades. Revealed as powerful tools to assess regional vulnerability, network longevity and resilience, communication efficiency and biological cost, etc., they have found wide applications in studies including the pathology underlying neurological disorders, brain wiring principle, and functional configurations. However, although comprehensive visualisation (e.g. [Gephi](https://gephi.org)) and analysis tools (e.g. [BCT](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/Home), [igraph](http://igraph.org)) do exist, interactive platforms for network dynamics visualisation specially suited to brain network are yet to be more extensively explored. Inspired by Echarts\u2019 visualisation of airline/train routing ([demo](http://echarts.baidu.com/examples/editor.html?c=lines3d-flights&gl=1)), we propose an analogous interactive framework that allows for real-time visualisation of dynamics on brain network/sphere interactively in which the brain coordinates serve as geographic information. Users can customise their triggering events, if there is any, updating rules and colouring scheme specifically. Such tools would help reveal more straightforwardly the trajectories of network dynamics as well as the roles of individual nodes and edges.\r\n\r\n#### Goals:\r\n\r\n1. Wrap up classic network models, including linear threshold models and outing/navigation/spread models, as default\r\n2. Read user input of triggering events, updating rules of nodes and edges and project the corresponding events onto a 3D brain\r\n3. Preset several colouring themes\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Submitted by [Christophe Phillips](https://github.com/ChristophePhillips)\r\n\r\n#### Introduction:\r\n[Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com ) is a **professional open-source lightweight DICOM server**. Basically it can turn any computer running Windows, Linux or OS X into a DICOM store (in other words, a mini-PACS system). Its architecture is lightweight and standalone, meaning that no complex database administration is required, nor the installation of third-party dependencies.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to improve the DICOM flows and to support research about the automated analysis of medical images. Quite uniquely Orthanc provides a **RESTful API**, such that it is possible to drive Orthanc from any computer language. It also features a plugin mechanism to add new modules that extends the core capabilities of its REST API. A Web viewer, a PostgreSQL database back-end, and a reference implementation of DICOMweb are currently freely available as plugins.\r\n\r\n#### Summary:\r\n\r\nSo on the one hand, Orthanc is the best tool around to manage the flow of images originating from a MRI scanner but is designed to work with DICOM data. On the other hand, we researchers usually work with NIfTI images, ideally organised according to BIDS.\r\nIt would be so cool and convenient to visually or automatically check your data online on the Orthanc server, then with a click (or 2...) import them in the right format on whatever machine you use to process the images.\r\n\r\n#### Aim:\r\nThe project would consist in building an interface allowing the extraction of data, from a single subject of series of them, from an Orthanc server and convert these on the fly into BIDS-compliant NIfTI data. This would provide some form of GUI to easily integrate in a BIDS dataset data picked up from your lab-server or any other computer managing MR data with Orthanc.\r\nThe solution could be built around existing tools such as [Dcm2Bids](https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids).\r\n",

        "body": "Submitted by [CBIG group](https://yeolab.weebly.com/)*\r\n\r\nNeuroVault is an easy to use web database for brain statistical maps, atlases and parcellation maps. Currently, NeuroVault only accepts data that have been transformed into MNI space. With accurate surface/volume map translation, these data can also be utilised by people working on the surface (e.g. fsaverage space); surface space also provides better visualisation for cortical data. Our group recently published an accurate nonlinear MNI152/Colin27-fsaverage mapping method ([Registration Fusion](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion)), which can be integrated to NeuroVault to provide surface/volume map translation. \r\n\r\nThe steps to achieve this goal:\r\n1. Identify software dependencies for the Registration Fusion (RF) project\r\n2. Find out where the RF functions should be added (e.g. what existing script would call the RF functions)\r\n3. Port the RF project to Python\r\n4. Do we also need to add visualization for surface data?\r\n5. Add test or example data if needed\r\n\r\nThis will benefit people who are using NeuroVault.\r\n",

Our group is maintaining an [fMRI preprocessing pipeline](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016) that allows flexible preprocessing order. However, currently this pipeline is not very compatible with BIDS format. During OHBM hackathon, we would like to modify CBIG preprocessing pipeline so that it can automatically handle input data in BIDS format, and also reorganize input data into BIDS format if they are not.\r\n\r\nThe steps to achieve this goal:\r\n- Understand the folder structure of BIDS format;\r\n- Identify what are the files needed for CBIG preprocessing pipeline and how to locate them in BIDS format;\r\n- Write scripts to grab the needed files and pass to current preprocessing scripts;\r\n- Test on some data in BIDS format;\r\n- Re-run some GSP (Brain Genomics Superstruct Project) subjects to make sure original functionality is not affected.\r\n\r\nThis upgrade will benefit people who are using (or plan to use) CBIG fMRI preprocessing code.\r\n",

(Anisha also complained Satra's bad CSS habits). The abstract planner is again available this year, and we hope to make a few improvements so that people can use it. One specific change will be the ability for people to save abstracts to buckets and share and load these collections. These should be save-able locally with a URL that one can share to regenerate that list of abstracts. Please provide suggestions for improvement and help us improve it.\r\n",

We had moved workflows from BIPS to Nipype, and now we want to take them out again! Workflows are really difficult to maintain within Nipype: 1) Developers stop supporting them, 2) interfaces and underlying software dependencies change, and 3) testing workflows is rather intensive. Therefore, we are proposing a new organization [Niflows](https://github.com/niflows) within which neuroimaging workflows (not just Nipype ones) can be created, registered, maintained, and tested. During the hackathon we will discuss and hack on the principles by which workflows should be curated and dependencies managed, and hope to develop a starter-kit and a CLI manager. We would love your input (comments/criticisms) and/or your coding skills.\r\n",

As a starting point, we will provide (1a) a set of functions that use scikit-learn, nilearn, bct (+numpy, scipy, nistats,...) that can be used to estimate dynamic connectivity states with a set of connectivity metrics, sliding windows and clustering algorithms, (1b) as well as decomposition methods (e.g. ICA, dictionary learning) , (2) simple methods to calculate null statistical models using bootstrapping procedures, (3) dynamic graph theory metrics, and (4) basic visualizations. We encourage interested researchers to join us in order to either help building the examples, or contribute with new methods, or test our methods on their own data.\r\nwww.github.com/nicofarr/dynamicnetworks\r\n",

        "body": "Submitted by Tom Close\r\n\r\n#### Introduction\r\n\r\nI have been developing a framework for the analysis of large-scale, multi-modal/contrast studies called [Arcana (Abstraction of Repository-Centric ANAlysis)](https://github.com/monashbiomedicalimaging/arcana). Arcana builds on Nipype to encapsulate experimental data and associated analysis methods within _Study_ classes.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://files.aievolution.com/hbm1801/abstracts/abs_1676/workflow_diagram.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"></div>\r\n\r\n_Study_ classes specify:\r\n* A collection of related datasets to be acquired from an instrument (scanner). A primary dMRI and its reverse phase-encoding references for example\r\n* Products that can be derived from the given acquired datasets, including intermediate ones\r\n* Pipelines to derive the derivable products.\r\n* Free parameters of the pipelines\r\n* Switches to select between comparable pipelines (e.g. segmentation in FSL, ANTs, SPM, etc...)\r\n\r\nPlacing workflows for neuroimaging analysis within the Arcana framework should help to reduce code duplication, by avoiding the reimplementation of segments that are common to many analysis workflows (e.g. brain extraction), while allowing for specialisation for different MR contrasts through class inheritance. _Study_ classes for multi-modal/contrast experiments can be constructed by the combination of simpler classes into _MultiStudy_ classes, making it feasible to implement complete workflows for complex multi-contrast experiments.\r\n\r\nArcana also abstracts away many of the menial tasks involved with creating workflows such as repository access, data format conversion, session iteration, management of previously computed products, and the storage of provenance (under development).\r\n\r\nRepository access in Arcana has been implemented in a modular style that allows the selection of the repository modules at runtime. Repository modules currently exist for\r\n\r\n* XNAT (http://xnat.org)\r\n* Local. A custom directory format in which datasets stored in a two-tier directory structure organised by subject/visit.\r\n\r\n#### Project\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to add a BIDS repository module to Arcana, and achieving that, develop some BIDS apps using Arcana.\r\n\r\nGiven that the existing custom local directory format is fairly similar to BIDS it should hopefully not be too much work to convert the Local repository module to store data in BIDS format. The one exception may be tabular data, which there isn't a concept of in Arcana currently.\r\n\r\nSince BIDS specifies the names and types of datasets/products within the repository, it will be interesting to see whether it is practical to map Arcana's more general architecture on to it. The Arcana package itself only defines core workflow logic, not the implementations themselves. The workflow implementations we have been working on are in a separate repository (uninspiringly) named [NiAnalysis](https://github.com/monashbiomedicalimaging/nianalysis.git). So some of the work to implement BIDS support may need to be put in there instead.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Outcomes\r\n\r\nThe key benefits of adding a BIDS module to Arcana would be:\r\n\r\n* Simplify the implementation of complex workflows as BIDS apps (hopefully;)\r\n* Provide a means to create unified BIDS Apps/XNAT pipelines. \r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Submitted by Yulin Wang*\r\n\r\n#### **MOTIVATION:**\r\n\r\nAs physiology activity, mainly including the cardiac and respiratory activity, has already being proposed to constitute as a big part of the noise for the BOLD fMRI signal (for review, see *Bulte & Wartolowska, 2017*), it is important to look its effects more precisely with an emotion or emotion regulation task. Therefore, in the project, I would like to find out the role of physiological activity on BOLD signal by taking a task fmri dataset addressing the emotion regulating brain as an example. \r\n\r\n#### **OBJECT:**\r\n\r\nIn the project, the data-set comes from my own fMRI study (as an example), which addresses the repeated effects of two emotion regulation strategies in the brain. In this fMRI study, the respiration and heart rate activity were recorded simultaneously. To be noticed, this study was already pre-registered in the open science framework https://osf.io/. My previous idea was to regard the physiology activity as noise for the task related BOLD signal. As indicated in the preregistered report, I will regress them out in the first level to specify my GLM model. However, some researches argued that physiology activity plays also a vital role in emotional responses. It would be highly possible that we also regress out the task-related signal if we regress out the physiology influence in the first level. The aim is to work out a framework to decode the influence of the physiological activity in BOLD signal with a task fMRI. \r\n\r\n#### **PLAN:**\r\n\r\n#### A possible framework\r\n1. Step one\r\n\r\n   * Model (use RETROICOR, RVT, HRV) the physiological activity with PhysIO toolbox \r\n\r\n   * Aim: Read in the physiological activity, the pre-processing, and the noise modeling \r\n\r\n2. Step two\r\n\r\n   * Estimate (via tSNR) the modeling: clarify the influence of cardiac activity and the respiratory activity on BOLD signal\r\n   * Aim: Make sure that noise correction (via SPM GLM) is done by only regressing out the noisy part of the physiological activity; separate the signal and noise from the physiological activity\r\n\r\n3. Step three\r\n\r\n   * Use the physiological activity (the signal part) as parametric modulator in the GLM model\r\n   * Aim: to estimate cardiac and respiratory activity related  neural correlates during emotion regulation more precisely\r\n \r\n#### **SIGNIFICANCE**\r\n\r\nI think my project is of general interest for people who are doing fMRI studies, both on resting state and task fMRI. As physiology activity has already been proposed to constitute as a big part of the noise for the BOLD signal, it is really important to look its effects more precisely with an emotion or emotion regulation task. Considering researchers nowadays have collected more often the physiology data during their fMRI scanning, I think my project will stimulate a lot of ideas about how to deal with the physiology activity, which will provide some new insights into the field of neuroscience, not to mention that this project can add more values about open science.\r\n\r\n#### **Calling all the Neuroscientists and Programmers:**\r\n\r\nThe crucial part for this project is step two. It would be great if neuroscientists who are working on the similar topics and programmers who know a lot about modeling join the current project. It's a great opportunity to sit-together and work for science! \r\n",

The fMRI data comprises 3-D brain scans acquired over time. Each voxel of the 3-D brain volume contains a value denoting the signal intensity at a particular time for a certain task performed by the subject. Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects different regions of the brain, often involving hallucinations and delusions. Detecting the anomaly in temporal data and identifying the activated voxels will help to reduce the features for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Currently, techniques like GLM and ICA are used to detect the voxel activity and to reduce the data by removing the time variable. Identification of affected regions in schizophrenia may help us understand the condition and effect of disorder better and may also assist in deciding the line of treatment. \r\n\r\n#### The objectives of the Project: \r\n1) To find the relevant voxel having a significant change in activation.\r\n2) Developing a fast and simple tool for dimension reduction.\r\n3) Statistical analysis based feature selection for task-related fMRI data without giving prior information about \r\n   task details.\r\n\r\n#### The Plan of Work: \r\nThe fMRI data of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls performing auditory oddball (AUD) task, openly available at FBIRN phase II data repository will be used in this project. Each subject\u2019 data consist of four runs of AUD task. Mean and median-based statistical methods will be applied voxel-wise on the data of each subject, identifying the relevant voxels activated across their time course. Discrete wavelet transform may be applied voxel-wise to the fMRI time-series signals to detect outliers. The detection of outliers will help us to understand the nature of activation of the voxel, and the activated voxels may be selected as the relevant features to be fed into the classifier. The mean and median-based method may work better in terms of accuracy classifying the healthy and schizophrenia subjects when compared to features selected by standard GLM approach. To implement the project, tools like Matlab or Python will be used for coding, SPM8 will be used for GLM, and MriCro/ MANGO for visualization of the brain image.\r\n\r\n#### Benefit to the Community: \r\nTo the best of my knowledge, till date, there is no study performed on time-series fMRI data involving schizophrenia patients for outlier detection to select activated voxels that helps in the classification task. This project will throw light on the recent research on time-series analysis of task-related fMRI data and may act as an alternative option to the standard GLM approach to convert 4-D fMRI data into a 3-D statistical parametric map volume.\r\n\n\n### Type\n\nmethod_development\n\n### Development status\n\n1_basic structure\n\n### Topic\n\nother\n\n### Tools\n\nother\n\n### Programming language\n\nother\n\n### Modalities\n\nother\n\n### Git skills\n\n1_commit_push",

ASD heterogeneity is huge, symptom severity varies from severe impairment to mild impairment, and from requiring substantial support to requiring support. Consequently, a categorical approach and a behavioural assessment of the ASD core symptoms fail to detect ASD subjects in the upper spectrum. ASD subjects with mild impairments are susceptible of a misdiagnosis or a late diagnosis. \r\n\r\n#### Aim: \r\nThis project aims to find a functional connectivity based *biomarker* that can use a resting state fMRI scan for the following 2 purposes: \r\n1. To predict the severity scores such as - ADOS Total Score or SRS Score using these biomarkers. \r\n2. Trying to cluster the subjects into separable groups using the available phenotypic scores and those connectivity biomarkers and to discover multiple subtypes to which an autistic individual can belong to.  \r\nFor this we will use resting state fMRI scans from ABIDE.  \r\n\r\n#### Research Design: \r\n1. Employing a seed based functional connectivity analysis approach to build the connectome. \r\n2. Finding group level differences in functional connectivity between autistic and healthy subjects. \r\n3. Using those differences for the purpose of subject clustering or severity score prediction. \r\n\r\n#### Code Development (Python):   \r\nUsing nipype and scikit learn/nilearn to do the following: \r\n1. Making a preprocessing pipeline using nipype. \r\n2. Building functional connectivity maps. \r\n3. Using scikit learn/ nilearn to  for clustering subjects and predicting severity scores \r\n\r\n#### Calling all the Neuroscientists and Programmers: \r\nIt would be great if neuroscientists join this project as they know about brain anatomy and can hypothesize what brain connections might be impaired in Autism as a disorder of social communication. They  can help in deciding which seed regions to focus on and inspect. They can also help in interpreting the results. \r\nAlso, everyone can benefit a lot from programmers by learning efficient coding practices. \r\n\r\nIt's a great opportunity for both to come together and learn from each other. \n\n### Type\n\nmethod_development, pipeline_development\n\n### Development status\n\n1_basic structure\n\n### Topic\n\nmachine_learning\n\n### Tools\n\nNipype\n\n### Programming language\n\nPython\n\n### Modalities\n\nother\n\n### Git skills\n\n1_commit_push",

Sorry about the christmas tree, I worked on this in December. But we can do this with brains as well of course! I would like to:\r\n1. Exchange the tree for a 3D brain reconstruction. We will probably need to downsample a FreeSurfer reconstruction to make this work.\r\n2. Make a custom brain marker that includes a QR code to the appropriate link.\r\n3. Colour the brain with an activation map. \r\n4. Write scripts to automate this process. \r\nThe ultimate (way beyond hackathon) idea is of course to put a brain QR code on your poster and have it display your brain results in AR!\r\n\n\n### Type\n\nvisualization\n\n### Development status\n\n1_basic structure\n\n### Topic\n\ndata_visualisation\n\n### Tools\n\nother\n\n### Programming language\n\nother\n\n### Modalities\n\nDWI, fMRI, MRI, other\n\n### Git skills\n\n1_commit_push",

It would be great if instead, the nodes could be organised by functionality instead. \r\n* Primary goals:\r\n  1. Find a way to collect relevant metadata from Nipype nodes. [Relevant to Nipype]\r\n  2. List the nodes in an 'order by category' panel in Porcupine. [Relevant to Porcupine]\r\n* Secondary goals:\r\n  1. An annotation of this kind would be equally useful for the Nipype documentation. Some 'browse by category' functionality would be a welcome addition to the docs.\r\n* Stretch goals (or separate project):\r\n  1.

In this project, I would like to animate this process. Either by means of interactive graphics (along [these](https://plot.ly/python/animations/) lines) or via an Illustrator/Photoshop script to make an animated gif. The idea is to automatically generate the animation based on a (to-be-created) database of papers that pinpoint the corners of rectangles. This way, the animation is automatically updated when data is added.\r\n* Primary goals:\r\n  1. Come up with a way to stucture a mini database with the relevant information\r\n  2. Find a way to animate the relevant information\r\n  3. Get from 1. to 2.\r\n* Secondary goals:\r\n  * Find a small set of papers that define corner points of some methods and populate the database\r\n  * Annotate the visualisation, i.e. either have the papers pop up or make them clickable\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\nvisualization, other\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n0_concept_no_content\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\ndata_visualisation, other\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\nnot_applicable\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nnot_applicable\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n0_no_git_skills",
