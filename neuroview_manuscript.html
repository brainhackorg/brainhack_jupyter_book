<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Brainhack is an innovative meeting format that promotes scientific collaboration
and education in an open and inclusive environment. Departing from the formats
of typical scientific workshops, these events are based on grassroots projects
and training, and foster open and reproducible scientific practices. We describe
here the multifaceted, lasting benefits of Brainhacks for individual
participants, particularly early career researchers. We further highlight the
unique contributions that Brainhacks can make to the research community,
contributing to scientific progress by complementing opportunities available in
conventional formats.</p>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Social factors play a crucial role in the advancement of science. New findings
are discussed and theories emerge through social interactions, which largely
take place in individual research groups, and at academic events such as
conferences, seminars or workshops. This system tends to amplify the voices of a
select subset of the community—especially more established researchers—thus
limiting opportunities for the larger community to contribute and connect.
<a class="reference external" href="https://brainhack.org">Brainhack</a> events (or Brainhacks for short) complement
these formats in neuroscience with decentralized gatherings in which
participants from all backgrounds and career stages collaborate and learn from
each other in an informal setting. The Brainhack format was introduced in a
previous publication (<a class="reference external" href="#references">Craddock et al., 2016;</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#figure-1">Fig. 1A&amp;B</a>). It is inspired by the
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary_en.html"><span class="doc std std-doc"><strong>hackathon</strong></span></a> model (see Glossary), which originated
in software development and has gained traction in science as a way to bring
people together for collaborative work and educational courses. Unlike many
hackathons, Brainhacks welcome participants from all disciplines and with any
level of experience—from those who have never written a line of code to software
developers and expert neuroscientists. Brainhacks additionally feature informal
dissemination of research through
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary_en.html"><span class="doc std std-doc"><strong>unconferences</strong></span></a>, and replace the sometimes
competitive context of traditional hackathons with a purely collaborative one.
<a id="figure-1" name="figure-1"></a></p>
<p><img alt="Figure-1" src="_images/neuroview_figure-1.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 1. Brainhack in time and space.</em> (A) Anatomy of a Brainhack shows how
the components of Brainhack events relate to overarching topics that lead to
scientific and professional opportunities in neuroscience. (B) Timeline of a
Single Event describes the typical daily schedule throughout a brainhack.
Project work and educational activities occur simultaneously interspersed with
unconferences. (C) Brainhack Cartography displays cities across the world that
have hosted a Brainhack. Marker color indicates the year in which each city
hosted its first Brainhack, and marker size indicates the number of events
hosted in each city. (D) The Brainhack Timeline displays the number of events
per month since the inaugural Brainhack in September 2012, along with notable
happenings throughout the years. Months are only denoted in the first year with
a single letter; this ordering is repeated for all subsequent years.</p>
<p>In the following, we aim to address two key questions about the merits of a
Brainhack. First, how do participants benefit from attending a Brainhack?
Second, what is the relevance and importance of Brainhacks for neuroscience more
broadly? To answer these questions, we discuss how Brainhacks feature 1) a
<a class="reference external" href="#a-project-oriented-approach"><em>Project-Oriented Approach</em></a> that fosters active
participation and community-driven problem-solving; 2)
<a class="reference external" href="#learning-by-doing"><em>Learning By Doing</em></a>, which enables participants to gain
more intensive training, particularly in computational methods commonly featured
at Brainhacks; 3) training in
<a class="reference external" href="#open-science-collaborative-coding"><em>Open Science &amp; Collaborative Coding</em></a>
which helps participants become more effective collaborators across contexts; 4)
<a class="reference external" href="#a-focus-on-reproducibility"><em>A Focus on Reproducibility</em></a> which leads to more
robust scientific research; and 5) accelerated
<a class="reference external" href="#building-and-bridging-communities"><em>Building and Bridging of Communities</em></a>
which encourages inclusivity and seamless collaboration between researchers at
different career stages. Altogether, Brainhacks and similar formats are
increasingly recognized as a new way of doing science that extends traditional
academic settings. These events foster a new research culture that demands
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary_en.html"><span class="doc std std-doc"><strong>open science</strong></span></a> and celebrates diversity,
unlocking opportunities for scientific progress.</p>

<section id="a-project-oriented-approach">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>A Project-Oriented Approach<a class="headerlink" href="#a-project-oriented-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Brainhacks are fundamentally centered around attendee-led projects. At the
beginning of each Brainhack, participants pitch project ideas and form teams to
realize some of these ideas during the “hacking” sessions
(<a class="reference external" href="#figure-1">Fig. 1B</a>). The teams are dynamic, and their composition can change
throughout the course of a project. As participants group themselves based on
their common interest in a question, method or idea, interdisciplinary teams
naturally emerge. Each participant can hone diverse skills by being an active
part in multiple projects of interest. This is in contrast to the scientific
silos that often arise when scientists connect over a specific methodological or
conceptual approach. Brainhack projects promote the flow of information between
specialized domains within the multidisciplinary field of neuroscience. The
project-oriented structure of Brainhack enables everyone to be an active
participant at the event, with contributions taking a variety of forms.
Importantly, the term “hacking” is not used to refer to coding in particular,
but to describe an intensive form of work, eschewing strict conventions, and
often targeted at prototyping an idea within a short period of time.
Participants are therefore not required to have coding skills in order to make
meaningful contributions. An example of an impactful project that did not focus
on coding is
<a class="reference external" href="https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/stable">Open Brain Consent</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="#references">Bannier et al., 2020</a>). This project has developed consent form
templates for the collection and sharing of human neuroimaging data,
incorporating data protection standards such as the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. The consent forms can be used in ethics
approval procedures to ensure that the collected data is shareable, while the
participants’ privacy is protected.</p>
<p>Unlike some traditional hackathons, there is no competitive element to
Brainhacks. The focus is on collective and community-driven work, making the
events more welcoming for inexperienced participants. Neither the level of
completeness nor the publication potential determine the success of a project.
Instead, Brainhacks emphasize the value of collaborating, exploring
unconventional ideas, group thinking and building tools that benefit the
community. Exemplary of these values is a project that originated at the very
first Brainhack in 2012: The <a class="reference external" href="https://braincatalogue.org">Brain Catalogue</a>
provides magnetic resonance (MR) brain images of a range of different species
and allows multiple users to view and segment them on the web simultaneously.
Its successor, <a class="reference external" href="https://brainbox.pasteur.fr">BrainBox</a> has evolved to enable
real-time collaborative segmentation of any MR image accessible online
(<a class="reference external" href="#references">Heuer et al., 2016</a>). BrainBox has been used in many Brainhack
projects, research collaborations and science outreach events. Similarly,
<a class="reference external" href="https://braindr.us/">braindr</a> fosters citizen science while solving the problem
of visual quality control for massive datasets
(<a class="reference external" href="#references">Keshavan et al., 2019</a>). This app enables anyone to contribute to
scientific progress by swiping left or right on brain images to classify them as
clean or corrupted. The project originated from a hackathon in 2017, was
extended in a Brainhack project in 2018, and recently led to the development of
the extensible <a class="reference external" href="https://swipesforscience.org">SwipesforScience</a> citizen science
template.</p>
<p>Many Brainhack projects take on a life of their own and grow beyond a single
event. The open science approach embraced by the Brainhack community makes it
easier for anyone to contribute to, or take the lead in pushing projects forward
beyond their initial creation. For example, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rb643/Autism-Gradients">Autism Gradients</a> project, exploring
the cortical hierarchy in individuals with autism, was conceptualised at
Brainhack Global 2016. It was subsequently picked up by another group who
significantly extended the original idea and invited the initial Brainhack team
to collaborate on it. This resulted in a peer-reviewed publication
(<a class="reference external" href="#references">Hong et al., 2019</a>), multiple follow-up projects, two exchange
grants and several international workshops on the same topic. Another example is
the development of <a class="reference external" href="https://nighres.readthedocs.io/en/latest">Nighres</a>, a Python
package for processing high-resolution neuroimaging data. The initial project
spanned two Brainhacks in 2016, and resulted in a
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/juhuntenburg/laminar_python">toolbox</a> that made algorithms
for layer-specific analysis of the cortex easier to install and use. This
sparked the development of the full Nighres package, with a broader range of
functions and various contributors across several Brainhacks. Nighres has been
presented in a peer-reviewed publication
(<a class="reference external" href="#references">Huntenburg et al., 2018</a>), is actively maintained, and has been
used and cited in multiple studies.</p>
<p>These examples highlight how the project-oriented approach of Brainhacks
encourages active participation, and interdisciplinary collaboration that can
reach beyond a single event. The projects directly benefit the participants, who
can explore new ideas in a stimulating setting, leverage their projects for
career advancement and gain new skills. Brainhack projects also contribute to
the progress of the wider neuroscience community by fostering exchange between
scientific silos, resulting in multi-disciplinary tools, community-driven
guidelines and reference data, as well as traditional publication output.</p>

<section id="learning-by-doing">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Learning by Doing<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-by-doing" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Alongside projects, educational activities lie at the heart of Brainhack events.
Such activities include informal teaching between project teammates, theoretical
discussions in self-organized groups, “unconference” presentations, and
structured workshops on a particular tool or topic. A recent format for major
Brainhack events is the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary_en.html"><span class="doc std std-doc"><strong>TrainTrack</strong></span></a>, entirely
education-focused sessions that run all day, in parallel with work on projects
(<a class="reference external" href="#figure-1">Fig. 1A-B</a>). This format lowers the entry barrier for new
participants, enabling them to build relevant skills and familiarize themselves
with the structure and environment of a Brainhack before diving into their first
project. The variety of educational approaches supports different learning
styles. Furthermore, the informal nature of these activities empowers
participants to be proactive about learning and asking for help.</p>
<p>Brainhack instructors strive to share their produced materials with the
scientific community, including recorded presentations, slide decks, interactive
tutorials, and more. For example, all the materials developed for the
<a class="reference external" href="https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/traintrack/">TrainTrack of OHBM Brainhack 2020</a>
have been made publicly available so as to encourage reuse, redistribution,
and reproduction of the content. Educational content developed for Brainhacks
cover a range of topics including analytical and statistical methods (e.g.,
machine learning, data preprocessing), reproducible workflows (e.g., automated
pipelines, automated data standardization, software containers), and other
relevant concepts (e.g., preregistration, p-hacking). Many featured tools are
geared towards promoting more open and reproducible practices. The training
sessions are designed to be hands-on and interactive as they typically feature
small groups having active discussions. Participants are explicitly encouraged
to adopt what they learned at a Brainhack event to their own context and to
improve the teaching material with their own ideas.</p>
<p>Skills learned at Brainhacks are not constrained to those of a technical nature;
the event format provides a unique and safe opportunity for early career
researchers to develop their teamwork and leadership skills. Project teams are
often interdisciplinary, allowing participants to practice communicating beyond
their own field. Everyone is encouraged to propose and lead their own projects,
and the informal structure of the events often empowers more junior participants
to also take on a leadership role. The growing pool of training materials
provides a ready route to extend teaching opportunities to any member of the
community, including trainees. Such experiences are rare for junior researchers,
but crucial for their advancement. Altogether, the broad range of scientific and
professional training opportunities equips participants with a skill set which
is applicable across many domains and may therefore open up a greater range of
career opportunities.</p>
</section>
<section id="open-science-collaborative-coding">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Open Science &amp; Collaborative Coding<a class="headerlink" href="#open-science-collaborative-coding" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Despite the increasingly central role of programming in neuroscience research,
formal training in coding is not common in the neuroscience curriculum. In
addition, code is seldom shared across more than a few labs, and too often
seen and used by only a single individual. As a result, many scripts and
workflows are hard to reuse and share, and can contain undiscovered errors
(<a class="reference external" href="#references">Merali et al., 2010</a>).</p>
<p>By putting cross-disciplinary collaboration at its heart, Brainhacks have
brought awareness to the need for the usability, reusability and long-term
maintenance of tools. This comes with a shift of efforts, from individuals
creating tools for their own needs to a community actively contributing to an
existing resource, solving the aforementioned issues. Practices such as writing
good code and documentation, improving code readability, performing basic
version control, working collaboratively on a code base on GitHub, GitLab, or
BitBucket, and using appropriate open licences have become essential within the
community. These open practices and tools facilitate community-driven
development and ensure that tools are available to all researchers, fostering
global inclusivity. Brainhacks have also highlighted the importance of a variety
of “research objects’’ other than scientific papers (such as software,
tutorials, workflows, and datasets), a concept that is increasingly endorsed by
publishing venues such as F1000, RIO, eLife, Aperture, and others over the
years.</p>
<p>Mastering collaborative programming skills enables Brainhack participants to
contribute to open research objects which impact the wider scientific community.
It can also make them more efficient at conducting their own research, for
example when skills like version control are transferred to their own research
group and foster more seamless collaboration amongst lab members. The wider
neuroscience community benefits from the creation of transparent, reproducible
toolsets, and from researchers equipped with the skills to maintain and extend
them.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-focus-on-reproducibility">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>A Focus on Reproducibility<a class="headerlink" href="#a-focus-on-reproducibility" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In line with their open, transparent and collaborative nature, Brainhacks have
fostered an increased awareness of the importance of reproducible practices that
integrate easily into research workflows. In addition to the coding practices
mentioned above, an important aspect of reproducibility is data sharing. Public
datasets feature extensively in Brainhack projects and training sessions, since
they are ideal for testing out new ideas or learning how to use a new tool.
First-time users thus experiment with these datasets and related tools under the
guidance of expert users, which lowers the barrier to working with public data
in the future. This approach establishes open data sharing as a standard
practice and teaches participants how to curate their data and metadata in a way
that will be accessible and reusable by others.</p>
<p>Resources that help researchers handle their data in a reproducible fashion are
integral to Brainhacks; many of these have been introduced to the Brainhack
community through structured efforts from the Center for Reproducible
Neuroimaging Computation (<a class="reference external" href="#references">Kennedy et al., 2019</a>). For example,
many projects and trainings use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.datalad.org">DataLad</a>, a tool that
not only lets participants version-control their own data, but also helps them
find, access, share, and work with increasingly large publicly available
datasets. Similarly, a growing number of projects build on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://bids.neuroimaging.io">Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="#references">Gorgolewski et al., 2016</a>), a community standard for the
organization of brain imaging data and metadata founded at the International
Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF). Introducing participants to data
standards, such as BIDS, in the environment of a Brainhack allows them to
experience the benefits of a unified data organisation and provides them with
the skillset to use these formats in their own research. By creating a
scientific culture around open and standardized data, metadata, and methods, as
well as detailed documentation and reporting, Brainhacks promote fundamental
building blocks of a more efficient and reliable scientific research process.</p>
</section>
<section id="building-and-bridging-communities">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>Building and Bridging Communities<a class="headerlink" href="#building-and-bridging-communities" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>All aspects of Brainhacks discussed above build upon an active commitment to a
diverse, inclusive, and non-hierarchically organized community. This commitment
has been formalized in a Code of Conduct that aims to ensure a safe and
welcoming environment for participants from all backgrounds. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://brainhack.org/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> is discussed at
the beginning of a Brainhack and adherence is monitored throughout the event.
While far from perfect or bias-free, we are pleased to witness that the
Brainhack community is continuously growing more diverse in terms of race,
gender, sexual orientation, career stage, and more. The enthusiastically
inclusive culture helps members hold each other to a standard of mutual respect
that empowers individuals from typically underrepresented groups to claim their
space and take on central roles in the community.</p>
<p>Brainhacks are designed to promote intensive networking. The project-oriented
and decentralized setting puts participants on an equal footing regardless of
backgrounds and career stage. Unconferences provide a unique opportunity for
people interested in the same topic to meet and discuss, sometimes sparking new
collaborations. Working in small groups during projects, workshops, and
unconferences over the course of several days encourages frequent interactions
that often go deeper than relatively short encounters at traditional
conferences. These interactions frequently lead to lasting collaborations that
bridge across disciplines, research contexts, career stages, and geographical
areas. Sometimes they lead to job opportunities. Often they turn into
friendships. We firmly believe that growing this diverse community and insisting
on a culture of collaboration and inclusivity has untold benefits for the
retention and well-being of all scientists doing brain research.</p>
<p>The general format of project-oriented, community-building events has gained
traction in the field of neuroscience and beyond. Brainhack Global is our major
yearly event that has sparked numerous simultaneous events around the world
since 2012; the focus on open collaboration through virtual spaces throughout
the years meant that when events were compelled to go virtual in 2020, the
community had the infrastructure and knowledge to readily organize and attend
virtual events around the world. Large initiatives such as the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/education/participatecollaborate/infrastructure-events-training/">Human Brain Project</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons">Neurodata Without Borders</a>,
and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://improvingpsych.org">Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science</a>
have also chosen hackathons as a primary work format. Summer schools like the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.abcd-repronim.org/index.html">ABCD-ReproNim</a> course,
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurohackademy.org/">NeuroHackademy</a>, and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://brainhackmtl.github.io/school2019/">Brainhack School</a> are based on the
same principles as the original Brainhack events. Thus, a strong ecosystem has
emerged that transports the benefits and values of the format far beyond any
individual event. Brainhacks are spreading to an increasingly wide community, as
the non-hierarchical, self-organising structure enables individuals to organize
a Brainhack anywhere in the world (<a class="reference external" href="#figure-1">Fig. 1C</a>) and events are kept
financially accessible. An online community with over 4000 members and 500
channels uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.brainhack.org">Mattermost</a> messaging
platform to provide continuity across time and space. Posts range from questions
about a specific resource, to job openings and discussions about research
ethics; and anyone can join regardless of having attended a Brainhack. The
community evolves with every new member and their ideas, and many members become
local advocates for the principles of open and collaborative science in their
home institutions.</p>

<section id="conclusion-future-directions">
<h2>Conclusion &amp; Future Directions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-future-directions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Brainhacks complement traditional academic settings and offer additional
opportunities for participants to achieve their scientific and professional
goals. The focus on building a community that promotes open science and
inclusivity has naturally led to better coding practices, more reproducible
methods, and ample opportunities for collaboration. Brainhacks differ from many
scientific meetings, as they are more project-oriented, less formal and less
directed at producing and broadcasting publications. Within neuroscience,
Brainhacks have the potential to evolve beyond their initial focus on
neuroimaging data and include more projects on theory, hardware, and different
types of neural data. With a growing global community, and an iteratively
improving format (<a class="reference external" href="#figure-1">Fig. 1D</a>), Brainhacks provide a successful
template that can easily be extended to other scientific fields. A near decade
of Brainhacks has brought about positive change for individual researchers and
the field as a whole, in the form of improved skills, reusable resources, new
collaborations and a diverse and inclusive community.</p>
